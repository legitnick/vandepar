<p>When I download a game, <strong>is it possible to launch and play a single player game under Steam and continue downloading others games in the meanwhile</strong>?</p>

<p>Steam stops my download as soon as I launch any game, and I am looking for a way to prevent this.</p>

<p>You can now allow downloads during <em>any</em> gameplay from the downloads settings:</p>

<h2>Per game option</h2>

<p>You can now tell Steam to continue downloading updates/games while playing games from your games' properties. Note that this setting is <em>not available for non-steam games</em>, which will always use the global setting.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pause all of the downloads manually.</li>
<li>Launch the game I want to play.</li>
<li>Alt-Tab back to Steam window, resume all downloads manually.</li>
<li>Alt-Tab back to the game and enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems that it only stops the download for you on launching a game. I have not found an "official" way to do it, but this way works until they give us one.</p>

  <p><strong>Fixed downloading new update while game is still running</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition, the new content system will allow us to build several new features that we’ve often heard requested. Upcoming client releases will include things like download scheduling, bandwidth throttling, and prioritizing which games get downloaded first. <strong>You’ll also be able to download an update to a game while you’re playing that game</strong>; Steam will apply the update after you exit the game.</p>

<p>Some people are talking about downloads being suspended, but I have never experienced this problem. I suggest choosing another server and trying again if this happens to you.</p>

<hr>

<p>Apparently, a new feature is coming.</p>

I have noticed that some games do not pause your downloads, but most games do.</p>
