<p>Since this answer was posted, a new option has been created and that should be preferred.

These are often done due to config file overrides, authentication credentials, etc. Please look at <a href="https://gist.github.com/1423106" rel="noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/1423106</a> for ways people have worked around the problem.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have your application look for an ignored file config-overide.ini and use that over the committed file config.ini (or alternately, look for ~/.config/myapp.ini, or $MYCONFIGFILE)</li>
<li>Commit file config-sample.ini and ignore file config.ini, have a script or similar copy the file as necessary if necessary.</li>
<li>Try to use gitattributes clean/smudge magic to apply and remove the changes for you, for instance smudge the config file as a checkout from an alternate branch and clean the config file as a checkout from HEAD.  This is tricky stuff, I don't recommend it for the novice user.</li>
<li>Keep the config file on a deploy branch dedicated to it that is never merged to master.  When you want to deploy/compile/test you merge to that branch and get that file.  This is essentially the smudge/clean approach except using human merge policies and extra-git modules.</li>
<li>Anti-recommentation: Don't use assume-unchanged, it will only end in tears (because having git lie to itself will cause bad things to happen, like your change being lost forever).</li>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 55 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><h3>What didn't work for me</h3>
<p>(Under Linux), I wanted to use the posts here suggesting the <code>ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs git rm -r --cached</code> approach.  However, (some of) the files to be removed had an embedded newline/LF/<code>\n</code> in their names.  Neither of the solutions:</p>
<pre><code>git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs -d&quot;\n&quot; git rm --cached
git ls-files --ignored --exclude-standard | sed 's/.*/&quot;&amp;&quot;/' | xargs git rm -r --cached

<p>cope with this situation (get errors about files not found).</p>
<h3>So I offer</h3>
<pre><code>git ls-files -z --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs -0 git rm -r --cached
git commit -am &quot;Remove ignored files&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This uses the <code>-z</code> argument to <strong>ls-files</strong>, and the <code>-0</code> argument to <strong>xargs</strong> to cater safely/correctly for &quot;nasty&quot; characters in filenames.</p>
<p>In the manual page <strong>git-ls-files(1)</strong>, it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When -z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in
pathnames are represented as \t, \n, and \\, respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so I think my solution is needed if filenames have any of these characters in them.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 19 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I think, that maybe Git can't totally forget about a file because of its conception (<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">section &quot;Snapshots, Not Differences&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>This problem is absent, for example, when using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CVS</a>. CVS stores information as a list of file-based changes. Information for CVS is a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.</p>
<p>But in Git every time you commit, or save the state of your project, it basically takes a picture of what <em><strong>all your files</strong></em> look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. So, if you added file once, it will always be present  in that snapshot.</p>
<p>These two articles were helpful for me:</p>
<p><a href="http://fallengamer.livejournal.com/93321.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">git assume-unchanged vs skip-worktree</a> and <a href="http://blog.stephan-partzsch.de/how-to-ignore-changes-in-tracked-files-with-git/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to ignore changes in tracked files with Git</a></p>
<p>Basing on it I do the following, if the file is already tracked:</p>
<pre><code>git update-index --skip-worktree &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>From this moment all local changes in this file will be ignored and will not go to remote. If the file is changed on remote, conflict will occur, when <code>git pull</code>. Stash won't work. To resolve it, <em>copy the file content to the safe place</em> and follow these steps:</p>
<pre><code>git update-index --no-skip-worktree &lt;file&gt;
git stash
git pull
</code></pre>
<p>The file content will be replaced by the remote content. Paste your changes from the safe place to the file and perform again:</p>
<pre><code>git update-index --skip-worktree &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If everyone, who works with the project, will perform <code>git update-index --skip-worktree &lt;file&gt;</code>, problems with <code>pull</code> should be absent. This solution is OK for configurations files, when every developer has their own project configuration.</p>
<p>It is not very convenient to do this every time, when the file has been changed on remote, but it can protect it from overwriting by remote content.</p>

<p>How do you force <code>git</code> to completely forget about [a file]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, this solution will cause the file to be <strong>deleted</strong> in every other instance of the repository when executing a <code>git pull</code>!</p>
<p>The correct way to force Git to forget about a file is documented by GitHub <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the documentation, but basically:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch --all
git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch full/path/to/file' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
</code></pre>
<p>Just replace <code>full/path/to/file</code> with the full path of the file. Make sure you've added the file to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>
<p>You'll also need to (temporarily) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10544328/4901390">allow non-fast-forward pushes to your repository</a>, since you're changing your Git history.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Because <code>/.git/info/exclude</code> can be applied to all historical commits using the instructions above, perhaps details about getting a <code>.gitignore</code> file <em>into</em> the historical commit(s) that need it is beyond the scope of this answer.  I wanted a proper <code>.gitignore</code> file to be in the root commit, as if it was the first thing I did.  Others may not care since <code>/.git/info/exclude</code> can accomplish the same thing regardless where the <code>.gitignore</code> file exists in the commit history, and clearly rewriting history is a <strong>very</strong> touchy subject, even when aware of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1491001">ramifications</a>.</p>
<p>FWIW, potential methods may include <code>git rebase</code> or a <code>git filter-branch</code> that copies an <em>external</em> <code>.gitignore</code> into each commit, like the answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/43463687">this question</a>.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Enforcing Git ignore behavior after-the-fact by committing the results of a stand-alone <code>git rm --cached</code> command may result in newly-ignored file <strong>deletion</strong> in future pulls from the force-pushed remote. The <code>--prune-empty</code> flag in the following <code>git filter-branch</code> command avoids this problem by automatically removing the previous &quot;delete all ignored files&quot; index-only commit.  Rewriting Git history also changes commit hashes, which will <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1491001">wreak havoc</a> on future pulls from public/shared/collaborative repositories.  Please understand the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1491001">ramifications</a> fully before doing this to such a repository. <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository" rel="noreferrer">This GitHub guide</a> specifies the following:</p>

<p>Tell your collaborators to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing" rel="noreferrer">rebase</a>, <em>not</em> merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history. One merge commit could reintroduce some or all of the tainted history that you just went to the trouble of purging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternative solutions that <strong>do not</strong> affect the remote repository are <code>git update-index --assume-unchanged &lt;/path/file&gt;</code> or <code>git update-index --skip-worktree &lt;file&gt;</code>, examples of which can be found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20241145">here</a>.</p>

<p>But when I used the command <code>git log -p</code>, the content of the file (which was secret credentials of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3" rel="noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) was showing the content which was removed and I don't want to show this content ever on the history of the Git repository.</p>
<p>Then I used this command:</p>
<pre><code>git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .envrc' HEAD
</code></pre>
<p>And I don't see the content again.</p>

<pre><code>git config --global alias.exclude-ignored '!git ls-files -z --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs -0 git rm -r --cached &amp;&amp;  git ls-files -z --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs -0 git stage &amp;&amp;  git stage .gitignore &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;new gitignore and remove ignored files from index&quot;'

<p>Breaking it down:</p>
<pre><code>git ls-files -z --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs -0 git rm -r --cached
git ls-files -z --ignored --exclude-standard | xargs -0 git stage
git stage .gitignore
git commit -m &quot;new gitignore and remove ignored files from index&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>remove ignored files from the index</li>
<li>stage .gitignore and the files you just removed</li>
<li>commit</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>java -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M
</code></pre>
<p>If you'd like to specify files by name, you can do that too:</p>
<pre><code>java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files *.mp4
</code></pre>
<p>The BFG is 10-1000x faster than <code>git filter-branch</code> and is generally much easier to use - check the <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/#usage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">full usage instructions</a> and <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">examples</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The <em>.gitignore</em> file finally ignores tracked-but-deleted files. You can test this for yourself by running the following script. The final <code>git status</code> statement should report &quot;nothing to commit&quot;.</p>
<pre><code># Create an empty repository
mkdir gitignore-test
cd gitignore-test
git init

# Create a file and commit it
echo &quot;hello&quot; &gt; file
git add file
git commit -m initial

# Add the file to gitignore and commit
echo &quot;file&quot; &gt; .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m gitignore

# Remove the file and commit
git rm file
git commit -m &quot;removed file&quot;

# Reintroduce the file and check status.
# .gitignore is now respected - status reports &quot;nothing to commit&quot;.
echo &quot;hello&quot; &gt; file
git status
</code></pre>

<p><code>git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf path/to/your/file' HEAD</code>

<p>In this, we are basically trying to rewrite the history of that particular file in previous commits also.</p>
