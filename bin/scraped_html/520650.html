<p><strong>As of Git 1.8.0:</strong></p>
<pre><code>git branch -u upstream/foo
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if local branch <code>foo</code> is not the current branch:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -u upstream/foo foo
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you like to type longer commands, these are equivalent to the above two:</p>
<pre><code>git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/foo

git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/foo foo
</code></pre>
<p><strong>As of Git 1.7.0 (before 1.8.0):</strong></p>
<pre><code>git branch --set-upstream foo upstream/foo
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All of the above commands will cause local branch <code>foo</code> to track remote branch <code>foo</code> from remote <code>upstream</code>.</li>
<li>The old (1.7.x) syntax is deprecated in favor of the new (1.8+) syntax.  The new syntax is intended to be more intuitive and easier to remember.</li>
<li>Defining an upstream branch will fail when run against newly-created remotes that have not already been fetched. In that case, run <code>git fetch upstream</code> beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Set up the 'remote' if you don't have it already</p>

<p>Now configure master to know to track:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push -u origin branch-name

<p>The equivalent long option is <code>--set-upstream</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>git-branch</code> command also understands <code>--set-upstream</code>, but its use can be confusing. <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/10/1/419" rel="noreferrer">Version 1.8.0</a> modifies the interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>git branch --set-upstream</code> is deprecated and may be removed in a relatively distant future.  <code>git branch [-u|--set-upstream-to]</code> has been introduced with a saner order of arguments.</p>
<p>â€¦</p>
<p>It was tempting to say <code>git branch --set-upstream origin/master</code>, but that tells Git to arrange the local branch &quot;origin/master&quot; to integrate with the currently checked out branch, which is highly unlikely what the user meant. The option is deprecated; use the new <code>--set-upstream-to</code> (with a short-and-sweet <code>-u</code>) option instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say you have a local <code>foo</code> branch checked out and want it to use a branch by the same name as its upstream. Make this happen with</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/foo
</code></pre>

One nice feature is that you can ask a <code>grb</code> command to explain what git commands it would execute.</p>
