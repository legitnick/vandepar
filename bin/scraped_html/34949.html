All of them. To this end, I wound up picking up five iron warhammers...only to find out that I had exceeded my maximum weight carrying capacity and that my character had been slowed to a snail's pace. This simply cannot do: I need to make sure I have as much storage space as possible so I can sell as much as possible and become rich quickly. How do I increase the amount of storage space my character can carry? Alternatively, is there a way to disable this system altogether? I find it very annoying.</p>

<li>When you level up, if you select stamina, you will increase your
carry weight by 5 pounds.</li>
<li>Also for 3 perk points, you can get the Extra Pockets perk in the
Pickpocket tree which increases your carrying capacity by 100. This
perk does require 50 skill in Pickpocket.</li>
<li>The Light Armor and Heavy armor trees have perks that let your armor
become weightless.  

<ul>
<li>Weightless Heavy Armor costs 4 perks, and needs    70 skill.</li>
<li>Weightless Light Armor costs 3 perks, and 50 skill.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There are pieces of armor with the 'Fortify Carry Weight' enchantment</li>
<li>There are <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Fortify_Carry_Weight">6 alchemical ingredients</a> with the 'Fortify Carry Weight' property and potions of the same name.</li>
<li>Finally, if you can find it, the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Standing_Stones">Steed Stone</a> will also increase how
much you can carry.</li>

<p>Or you can wait for a mod after the construction set is available.</p>

<p>Heavy Armor perk of Cushioned allows worn heavy armor to weight nothing (and no movement penalty)</p>

<p>Light Armor perk similar to Cushioned for same effect for light armor. I find that getting the light armor perk also applies to heavy armor (favorable bug in my X360 version)</p>

<p>Steed Stone active gives +100 carry weight</p>

<p>Upgrading your Stamina gives +5 carry weight (equipment with +stamina doesn't)</p>

<p>Equipment enchanted with Carry Weight gives +x carry weight. Qualifying equipment that can be worn at same time includes Gloves, Boots, Necklace, and Ring. You can get +40 on each of those once you have 100 enchantment, use a grand soul, and Enchanter's Philfer.
...</p>

<p>Get a house ASAP so you can put your unused, heavy, don't want to sell items safely in chest or special display (book shelves, weapon racks, or mannequins)</p>

<p>Get a follower that can carry your extra crap. They don't seem to benefit from armor extra carry perks so give them light armor and light weapons. The armor you give them has to be better than their "default" for them to wear it which means you will need to Smith upgrade or Enchant upgrade to get them to use light armor over their default heavy in some cases.
...</p>

<p>My advise is to only carry what you need. Don't worry about money, once you can Enchant, Smith, or Alchemy at high levels you will be making more money than you know what to do with.</p>

<p>For skill upgrades, I recommend you focus on Speech and Alchemy in terms of trainers. You can pickpocket them after each paid training (provided good enough pickpocketing). Don't do multiple pickpockets as the chance to pickpocket successfully is inversely proportional to value to be swiped. Save often in this scenario as 90% success seems to be the cap. The perk to steal coins more easily might be worth your effort or enchanted apparel for pickpocketing (like what you get for joining Thieves Guild) or potions.</p>

<p>~500-1000 gold for training + pickpocket seems like too good a way to basically upgrade two skills (the one you paid and pickpocketing) very quickly.</p>

This is also how you would give them new armor or weapons, they will equip anything better than what they are currently using.</p>

<p>Also, use the "I want you to do something for me" statement on your companion. You can have them take the entire contents of an unlocked box or just throw your burdens on the ground and have them pick it up. Companions have unlimited carryweight this way.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>There are different boots that can improve the maximum amount of weight you can carry:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imperial Boots of Lifting</li>
<li>Leather Boots of Lifitng</li>
<li>Hide Boots of Lifting</li>
</ul>

<p>If I remember well you can get one as a prize for the main quest in Whiterun, but I also found them looting around.</p>

<p>Another idea, once you find the enchantment, is to enchant clothes (they have minimal weight) with "carrying" enchants. This way, if you get encumbered, you can don on a piece of clothing to help.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>There is another option, called the Steed Stone. It's one of thirteen guardian stones which, if you visit and activate them, give you perks. The seed stone is located due west of the Thalmor Embassy, at the very top of that tall mountain you can see on the map. Climb up the mountain, and you'll find a large stone. Just press "E" to activate it, and you receive carry weight + 100, I believe, and your armor becomes weightless.</p>
