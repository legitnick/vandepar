</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 12337 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don't know how it works.  But it's actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I'll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.</p>
<p>Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.</p>
<pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
    ↑
  master
</code></pre>
<h3>Option 1: <code>git reset --hard</code></h3>
<p>You want to <strong>destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes</strong>.  You do this:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre><code> (F)
A-B
  ↑
master
</code></pre>
<p>Now B is the HEAD.  Because you used <code>--hard</code>, your files are reset to their state at commit B.</p>
<h3>Option 2: <code>git reset</code></h3>
<p>Maybe commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off.  You want to <strong>undo the commit but keep your changes</strong> for a bit of editing before you do a better commit.  Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:</p>
<pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
    ↑
  master
</code></pre>
<p>Do this, leaving off the <code>--hard</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git reset HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the result is:</p>
<pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
  ↑
master
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit.  When you do a <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit.  But (unless you use <code>--hard</code>) you leave your files as they were.  So now <code>git status</code> shows the changes you had checked into C.  You haven't lost a thing!</p>
<h3>Option 3: <code>git reset --soft</code></h3>
<p>For the lightest touch, you can even <strong>undo your commit but leave your files and your <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/WhatIsTheIndex" rel="noreferrer">index</a></strong>:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<p>This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your <em>index</em> alone.  When you do <code>git status</code>, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before.  In fact, right after this command, you could do <code>git commit</code> and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.</p>
<h3>Option 4: you did <code>git reset --hard</code> and need to get that code back</h3>
<p>One more thing: Suppose you <strong>destroy a commit</strong> as in the first example, <strong>but then discover you needed it after all</strong>?  Tough luck, right?</p>
<p>Nope, there's <em>still</em> a way to get it back.  Type this</p>
<pre><code>git reflog
</code></pre>
<p>and you'll see a list of (partial) commit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity" rel="noreferrer">shas</a> (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in.  Find the commit you destroyed, and do this:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed
</code></pre>
<p>You've now resurrected that commit.  Commits don't actually get destroyed in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you didn't mean to get rid of.</p>

<h2>How to undo a local commit</h2>
<p>Let's say I committed locally, but now I want to remove that commit.</p>
<pre><code>git log
    commit 101: bad commit    # Latest commit. This would be called 'HEAD'.
    commit 100: good commit   # Second to last commit. This is the one we want.

git reset --hard HEAD^     # Use --hard if you don't care about keeping the changes you made
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>git log</code> will show that our last commit has been removed.</p>
<h2>How to undo a public commit</h2>
<p>If you have already made your commits public, you will want to create a new commit which will &quot;revert&quot; the changes you made in your previous commit (current HEAD).</p>
<pre><code>git revert HEAD
</code></pre>
<p>Your changes will now be reverted and ready for you to commit:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m 'restoring the file I removed by accident'
git log
    commit 102: restoring the file I removed by accident
    commit 101: removing a file we don't need
    commit 100: adding a file that we need

<h2 id="to-revert-a-commit-rotb">To revert a commit</h2>
<p>Amending a commit is the ideal solution if you need to change the last commit, but a more general solution is <code>reset</code>.</p>
<p>You can reset Git to any commit with:</p>
<pre><code>git reset @~N
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>N</code> is the number of commits before <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>@~</code> resets to the previous commit.</p>
<p>Instead of amending the commit, you could use:</p>
<pre><code>git reset @~
git add *.java
git commit -m &quot;Add .java files&quot;

<h2 id="reflog-hdrm">Reflog</h2>

<h2>How to undo the previous local commit</h2>

<p>Just reset your branch to the previous location (for example, using <code>gitk</code> or <code>git rebase</code>). Then reapply your changes from a saved copy. After garbage collection in your local repository, it will be like the unwanted commit never happened. To do all of that in a single command, use <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>.</p>

<p>I am just adding two cents for @Kyralessa's answer:</p>
<p>If you are unsure what to use go for <code>--soft</code> (I used this convention to remember it --<strong>s</strong>oft for safe).</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>If you choose <code>--hard</code> by mistake you will <strong>LOSE</strong> your changes as it wasn't before.
If you choose <code>--soft</code> by mistake you can achieve the same results of <code>--hard</code> by applying additional commands</p>
<pre><code>git reset HEAD file.html
git checkout -- file.html
</code></pre>
<h3>Full example</h3>
<pre><code>echo &quot;some changes...&quot; &gt; file.html
git add file.html
git commit -m &quot;wrong commit&quot;

# I need to reset
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (cancel changes)
# OR
git reset --soft HEAD~1 # Back to staging
git reset HEAD file.html # back to working directory
git checkout -- file.html # cancel changes

<p><strong>Basic command to revert the commit in Git is:</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ git reset --hard &lt;COMMIT -ID&gt;

<p>or</p>
<pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD~&lt;n&gt;

<p><strong>COMMIT-ID</strong>: ID for the commit</p>
<p><strong>n:</strong>  is the number of last commits you want to revert</p>
<p>You can get the commit id as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>$ **git log --oneline**

d81d3f1 function to subtract two numbers

be20eb8 function to add two numbers

bedgfgg function to multiply two numbers
</code></pre>
<p>where <strong>d81d3f1</strong> and <strong>be20eb8</strong> are commit id.</p>
<p><strong>Now, let's see some cases:</strong></p>
<p><em>Suppose you want to revert the last commit 'd81d3f1'.  Here are two options:</em></p>
<pre><code>$ git reset --hard d81d3f1

<p><strong>You haven't pushed the commit yet</strong></p>

<p>If the problem was extra files you commited (and you don't want those on repository), you can remove them using <code>git rm</code> and then commiting with <code>--amend</code></p>

<pre><code>git rm &lt;pathToFile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also remove entire directories with <code>-r</code>, or even combine with other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29">Bash</a> commands</p>

<pre><code>git rm -r &lt;pathToDirectory&gt;
git rm $(find -name '*.class')
</code></pre>

<p>After removing the files, you can commit, with <strong>--amend</strong> option</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend -C HEAD # the -C option is to use the same commit message
</code></pre>

<p>This will rewrite your recent local commit removing the extra files, so, these files will never be sent on push and also will be removed from your local .git repository by GC.</p>

<p><strong>You already pushed the commit</strong></p>

<p>You can apply the same solution of the other scenario and then doing <code>git push</code> with the <code>-f</code> option, but it is <strong>not recommended</strong> since it overwrites the remote history with a divergent change (it can mess your repository).</p>

<p>Instead, you have to do the commit without <code>--amend</code> (remember this about -amend`: That option rewrites the history on the last commit).</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 88 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Usually, you want to <strong>undo</strong> a commit because you made a mistake and you want to fix it - essentially what the OP did when he asked the question. Really, you actually want to <strong>redo</strong> a commit.</p>
<p>Most of the answers here focus on the command line. While the command line is the best way to use Git when you're comfortable with it, its probably a bit alien to those coming from other version control systems to Git.</p>
<p>Here's how to do it using a GUI. If you have Git installed, you already have everything you need to follow these instructions.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I will assume here that you realised the commit was wrong before you pushed it. If you don't know what pushing means, then you probably haven't pushed. Carry on with the instructions. If you have pushed the faulty commit, the least risky way is just to follow up the faulty commit with a new commit that fixes things, the way you would do it in a version control system that does not allow you to rewrite history.</p>
<p>That said, here's how to fix your most recent fault commit using a GUI:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your repository on the command line and start the GUI with <code>git gui</code></li>
<li>Choose &quot;Amend last commit&quot;. You will see your last commit message, the files you staged and the files you didn't.</li>

<p>There are tons of situations where you really want to undo that last commit into your code. E.g. because you'd like to restructure it extensively - or even discard it altogether!</p>

<p>In these cases, the "reset" command is your best friend:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p>The above command (reset) will rewind your current HEAD branch to the specified revision. In our example above, we'd like to return to the one before the current revision - effectively making our last commit undone.</p>

<p>Note the <code>--soft</code> flag: this makes sure that the changes in undone revisions are preserved. After running the command, you'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.</p>

<p>If you don't want to keep these changes, simply use the <code>--hard</code> flag. Be sure to only do this when you're sure you don't need these changes any more.</p>

<h1><strong><em><code>First of all what is HEAD?</code></em></strong></h1>

<p><code>HEAD</code> is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch.<br>
There can only be a single <code>HEAD</code> at any given time. (excluding <code>git worktree</code>)</p>

<p>The content of <code>HEAD</code> is stored inside <code>.git/HEAD</code> and it contains the 40 bytes SHA-1 of the current commit.</p>

<hr>

<h1><strong><em><code>detached HEAD</code></em></strong></h1>

<p>If you are not on the latest commit - meaning that <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to a prior commit in history its called <strong><em><code>detached HEAD</code></em></strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlavO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlavO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>On the command line, it will look like this- SHA-1 instead of the branch name since the <code>HEAD</code> is not pointing to the tip of the current branch</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qplvo.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qplvo.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<h2><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0l3s.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0l3s.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></h2>

<h3>A few options on how to recover from a detached HEAD:</h3>

<hr>

<h3><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout" rel="noreferrer"><code>git checkout</code></a></h3>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;commit_id&gt;
git checkout -b &lt;new branch&gt; &lt;commit_id&gt;
git checkout HEAD~X // x is the number of commits t go back
</code></pre>

<p>This will checkout new branch pointing to the desired commit.<br>
This command will checkout to a given commit.<br>
At this point, you can create a branch and start to work from this point on.</p>

<pre><code># Checkout a given commit. 
# Doing so will result in a `detached HEAD` which mean that the `HEAD`
# is not pointing to the latest so you will need to checkout branch
# in order to be able to update the code.
git checkout &lt;commit-id&gt;

# create a new branch forked to the given commit
git checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog" rel="noreferrer"><code>git reflog</code></a></h3>

<p>You can always use the <code>reflog</code> as well.<br>
<code>git reflog</code> will display any change which updated the <code>HEAD</code> and checking out the desired reflog entry will set the <code>HEAD</code> back to this commit. </p>

<p><strong>Every time the HEAD is modified there will be a new entry in the <code>reflog</code></strong></p>

<pre><code>git reflog
git checkout HEAD@{...}

<p>This will get you back to your desired commit</p>

<h3><strong><em><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset" rel="noreferrer"><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit_id&gt;</code></a></em></strong></h3>

<p>"Move" your HEAD back to the desired commit.</p>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code># This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:

git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.

<ul>
<li>Note: (<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.7.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Since Git 2.7</a>)<br>
you can also use the <code>git rebase --no-autostash</code> as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong><em><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert" rel="noreferrer"><code>git revert &lt;sha-1&gt;</code></a></em></strong></h3>

<p>"Undo" the given commit or commit range.<br>
The reset command will "undo" any changes made in the given commit.<br>
A new commit with the undo patch will be committed while the original commit will remain in the history as well.</p>

<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code># add new commit with the undo of the original one.
