<p>What?  How'd it happen?  No, no, that isn't impor—  Okay, fine.  It <em>might</em> have something to do with the <code>tim</code> command, a bandit chieftan, and an accident with an ebony greatsword.  But that's all you're getting out of me!</p>

<p>Now where was I?  Ah, yes.  Wherever I go, my head seems to be a few steps behind me, catching up at odd intervals only to be left behind again.  I just stopped to mine a corundum deposit, and my head fell to the ground and started rolling down the mountain!  <em>Very</em> embarrassing.</p>

<p>How can I fix this?  I was actually wandering around without any head at all for a while, but was able to restore it by <code>sexchange</code>ing twice.  Sadly, it doesn't appear to have been bolted on properly when it reappeared.  I can't even hide my deformity with a hat!</p>

<p>I'm making my <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12962279/StackExchange/Save%20124%20-%20Slitherskin%20%20Skyrim%20%2070.46.06.ess">medical records</a> available to anyone wishing to study my condition.</p>

<pre><code>objList.RemoveAll(x =&gt; !intList.Contains(x.id));
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Untested, but it'll be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var matches = from o in objList 
                  join i in intList on o.ID equals i
                  select o;
</code></pre>

<p>@Konrad just tested it, and it does work - I just had a typo where I'd written "i.ID" rather than "i".</p>
