<p>I get the following error when building my Windows Forms solution: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"LC.exe" exited with code -1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use two commercial Windows Forms Libraries: Infragistics and the Gantt-Control from plexityhide.com, that's why I have licenses.licx files in my WinForms Projects. We also use Visual Sourcesafe as our Source Control.</p>

<p>When the licenses.licx files are in the Projects I cannot build without the above error. However, when I exclude them from my projects the build works fine. But I need the licenses.licx files when I want to work with the commercial controls in the designer.</p>

<p>This is a brand new developer machine with Windows XP SP3 (German) and Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Software Developers (German) with SP1. </p>

<p>It's Windows XP 32-Bit by the way.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Problem mainly arises due to license file. Exclude the file <code>licenses.licx</code> from your project</p>
