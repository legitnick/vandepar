However, there is one thing that keeps irritating me every time I open Steam: the Team Fortress 2 Beta.  I don't want it, yet it is always in my games list.</p>

<p>I've tried contacting Steam Support since it seems I was unable to remove the games myself so far. This was their response; their only solution was to hide the games within my library:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for contacting Steam Support.</p>
  
  <p>Games cannot be removed from a Steam account.</p>
  
  <p>You are free to uninstall the game (right-click on the game name and
  select "Delete local content") and change your game list to show only
  installed games.</p>
  
  <p>This can be done by clicking "Show" in the upper left-hand corner.
  From here, select the "Installed" option.</p>
  
  <p>Another option would be to create a new category for only this title
  and then minimize the category.  To create a new Category, please
  right click the game and choose "Set Category".</p>
  
  <p>Then click on the category name in your Library to collapse the
  category.</p>
  
  <p>If you have any further questions, please let us know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, is there a way to remove games from my Steam library permanently? To clarify, I don't mean just by uninstalling, I mean by removing it from my library forever. </p>
