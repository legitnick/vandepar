<p>It occurred to me that we do not properly understand fire and its ability to spread from treetop to treetop. I am quite certain that I witnessed fire jumping from leaf block to leaf block over a span of at least two blocks of air, so clearly trees can catch fire even if they are not adjacent to a blaze.</p>

<p><strong>So what is the minimum safe spacing between trees?</strong></p>

<p>(A similar question was raised in <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/9344/properties-of-fire">Properties of Fire?</a>, but I thought this question could be focused on forest fires, which the other question doesn't appear to address in sufficient detail.)</p>
