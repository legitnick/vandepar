<p>It occurred to me that we do not properly understand fire and its ability to spread from treetop to treetop. I am quite certain that I witnessed fire jumping from leaf block to leaf block over a span of at least two blocks of air, so clearly trees can catch fire even if they are not adjacent to a blaze.</p>

<p><strong>So what is the minimum safe spacing between trees?</strong></p>

<p>(A similar question was raised in <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/9344/properties-of-fire">Properties of Fire?</a>, but I thought this question could be focused on forest fires, which the other question doesn't appear to address in sufficient detail.)</p>

However as you can see in the attached image, grass will also <em>sometimes</em> catch fire. So, to be safe when doing controlled burns, I definitely recommend a four-space buffer. If grass between your trees catches, that turns a safe three-space gap into an inferno friendly two-space gap.</p>

<p>(Thus, Rapida was correct.)</p>

<p><strong><em>SCIENCE!</em></strong></p>

<p>I noticed at one point that if you dig straight down and plant a seed in dirt, the trunk will reach the surface before sprouting.</p>

<p>I had this great idea for a log factory.  I dug all the way to the bottom, planted trees and waited (Actually it was multi-player, so I bailed and came back later).</p>

<p>Every time the trees had grown, instead of a tall, proud 64+brick long trunk I found a few burning trunk pieces (although there weren't many, there were enough to know that my experiment did work--they went from the bedrock to the surface).</p>

<p>At first I thought someone was setting the forest alight while I wasn't there, but later I figured out that fire from lava must be jumping THROUGH the solid stone around where I planted.</p>

<p>I don't know quite where the lava is, but it's common enough down at that level that you must almost always be close enough to catch fire.</p>

<p>Disappointing but I'm going to keep working on it.</p>

<p>Oh, ob. answer: If anyone has time to watch the process, my guess is that the occasional sparks sent off from fire and lava can set things within a few squares alight if they happen to hit--and that (possibly a bug) those sparks aren't stopped by solid objects.</p>
