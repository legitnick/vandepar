</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 365 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You want a block element that has what CSS calls shrink-to-fit width and the spec does not provide a blessed way to get such a thing. In CSS2, shrink-to-fit is not a goal, but means to deal with a situation where browser "has to" get a width out of thin air. Those situations are: </p>

<ul>
<li>float  </li>
<li>absolutely positioned element</li>
<li>inline-block element</li>
<li>table element</li>
</ul>

<p>when there are no width specified. I heard they think of adding what you want in CSS3. For now, make do with one of the above.</p>

<p>The decision not to expose the feature directly may seem strange, but there is a good reason. It is expensive. Shrink-to-fit means formatting at least twice: you cannot start formatting an element until you know its width, and you cannot calculate the width w/o going through entire content. Plus, one does not need shrink-to-fit element as often as one may think. Why do you need extra div around your table? Maybe table caption is all you need.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 260 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I think using</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>display: inline-block;
</code></pre>

<p>would work, however I'm not sure about the browser compatibility.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another solution would be to wrap your <code>div</code> in another <code>div</code> (if you want to maintain the block behavior):</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre class="lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div class="yourdiv"&gt;
        content
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>.yourdiv
{
    display: inline;
}
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 251 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><code>display: inline-block</code> adds an extra margin to your element.</p>

<p>I would recommend this:</p>

<pre class="lang-css prettyprint-override"><code>#element {
    display: table; /* IE8+ and all other modern browsers */
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> You can also now easily center that fancy new <code>#element</code> just by adding <code>margin: 0 auto</code>.</p>
