<p>Let's say I want to play Borderlands 2 without letting some friends know. Is there any way to hide my status to prevent them from knowing I'm playing it?</p>

<p>Basically, what I'm asking if Steam has an "Appear Offline" option.</p>

You can't do it for specific friends, but if you're just trying to play solo that will do the trick.</p>

You can then rename it whatever you want to make it less suspicious. Run it from steam and it will show you as in a non-steam game called whatever you decide to name it. Then run the game you actually want to play and your status will remain in the non-steam "game" you launched first.</p>

Set this to Private, but take note of the other profile items affected by this setting. Since it would hide so much of your profile, this old answer may still be useful:</p>

<p>You can maintain a "blue" online status while playing a Steam game. </p>

<p>This method requires multiple instances of Steam. For example, sign into the same Steam account on 2 different machines. Set your status to Offline in the instance you'll play your game from, and set the other instance's status to whatever you want your friends to see.</p>

<p>It actually should keep the Steam trolls from harassing you.</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/my/edit/settings" rel="noreferrer">Steam community settings page here,</a> it can be found at that link or as <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/275285/25368">this answer states,</a> on Steam go to <strong>Profile > Edit Profile > My Privacy Settings > Game details</strong><br>
At <em>Game Details</em> you can choose between public, friends only or private.</p>

  <p>This category includes the list of all games on your Steam account, games you’ve wishlisted, your achievements and your playtime. This setting also controls whether you’re seen as "in-game" and the title of the game you are playing.</p>

<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCAvO.png" alt="In the drop-down next to the person&#39;s name, I pick &quot;Block All Communication&quot;.">  </p>

<p>You might want to look at <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/108205/what-happens-when-i-block-someone-on-steam" title="What happens when I block someone on Steam? - Arqade">this question too</a> to be clearer, but basically it makes you appear as "offline" to that person only. However, like that post says, be careful because they can still see your real status if they go to your profile, whether they're logged in or not. If you're concerned about it, one counter is to set your profile as private to everyone, or just do like other answers say and set your status to Offline.</p>
