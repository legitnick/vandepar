<p>Likewise, I think it's generally recommended to use <code>String</code> if you need to refer specifically to the class.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of completeness, here's a brain dump of related information...</p>
<p>As others have noted, <code>string</code> is an alias for <code>System.String</code>. Assuming your code using <code>String</code> compiles to <code>System.String</code> (i.e. you haven't got a using directive for some other namespace with a different <code>String</code> type), they compile to the same code, so at execution time there is no difference whatsoever. This is just one of the aliases in C#. The complete list is:</p>
<pre class="lang-c# prettyprint-override"><code>object:  System.Object
string:  System.String
bool:    System.Boolean
byte:    System.Byte
sbyte:   System.SByte
short:   System.Int16
ushort:  System.UInt16
int:     System.Int32
uint:    System.UInt32
long:    System.Int64
ulong:   System.UInt64
float:   System.Single
double:  System.Double
decimal: System.Decimal
char:    System.Char
</code></pre>
<p>Apart from <code>string</code> and <code>object</code>, the aliases are all to value types. <code>decimal</code> is a value type, but not a primitive type in the CLR. The only primitive type which doesn't have an alias is <code>System.IntPtr</code>.</p>
<p>In the spec, the value type aliases are known as &quot;simple types&quot;. Literals can be used for constant values of every simple type; no other value types have literal forms available. (Compare this with VB, which allows <code>DateTime</code> literals, and has an alias for it too.)</p>
<p>There is one circumstance in which you <em>have</em> to use the aliases: when explicitly specifying an enum's underlying type. For instance:</p>
<pre class="lang-c# prettyprint-override"><code>public enum Foo : UInt32 {} // Invalid
public enum Bar : uint   {} // Valid
</code></pre>
<p>That's just a matter of the way the spec defines enum declarations - the part after the colon has to be the <em>integral-type</em> production, which is one token of <code>sbyte</code>, <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>ushort</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>ulong</code>, <code>char</code>... as opposed to a <em>type</em> production as used by variable declarations for example. It doesn't indicate any other difference.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to which to use: personally I use the aliases everywhere for the implementation, but the CLR type for any APIs. It really doesn't matter too much which you use in terms of implementation - consistency among your team is nice, but no-one else is going to care. On the other hand, it's genuinely important that if you refer to a type in an API, you do so in a language-neutral way. A method called <code>ReadInt32</code> is unambiguous, whereas a method called <code>ReadInt</code> requires interpretation. The caller could be using a language that defines an <code>int</code> alias for <code>Int16</code>, for example. The .NET framework designers have followed this pattern, good examples being in the <code>BitConverter</code>, <code>BinaryReader</code> and <code>Convert</code> classes.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 819 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><code>String</code> stands for <code>System.String</code> and it is a .NET Framework type. <strong><code>string</code> is an alias</strong> in the C# language for  <code>System.String</code>. Both of them are compiled to <strong><code>System.String</code> in IL</strong> (Intermediate Language), so there is no difference. Choose what you like and use that. If you code in C#, I'd prefer <code>string</code> as it's a C# type alias and well-known by C# programmers.</p>

<p>I can say the same about <strong>(<code>int</code>, <code>System.Int32</code>)</strong> etc..</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 581 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The best answer I have ever heard about using the provided type aliases in C# comes from Jeffrey Richter in his book <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0735621632" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CLR Via C#</a>. Here are his 3 reasons:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>I've seen a number of developers confused, not knowing whether to use <strong>string</strong> or <strong>String</strong> in their code. Because in C# the string (a keyword) maps exactly to System.String (an FCL type), there is no difference and either can be used.</li>
  <li>In C#, <strong>long</strong> maps to <strong>System.Int64</strong>, but in a different programming language, <strong>long</strong> could map to an <strong>Int16</strong> or <strong>Int32</strong>. In fact, C++/CLI does in fact treat long as an <strong>Int32</strong>. Someone reading source code in one language could easily misinterpret the code's intention if he or she were used to programming in a different programming language. In fact, most languages won't even treat <strong>long</strong> as a keyword and won't compile code that uses it.</li>
  <li>The FCL has many methods that have type names as part of their method names. For example, the <strong>BinaryReader</strong> type offers methods such as <strong>ReadBoolean</strong>, <strong>ReadInt32</strong>, <strong>ReadSingle</strong>, and so on, and the <strong>System.Convert</strong> type offers methods such as <strong>ToBoolean</strong>, <strong>ToInt32</strong>, <strong>ToSingle</strong>, and so on. Although it's legal to write the following code, the line with float feels very unnatural to me, and it's not obvious that the line is correct:</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(...);
float val  = br.ReadSingle(); // OK, but feels unnatural
Single val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK and feels good
</code></pre>

<p>So there you have it. I think these are all really good points. I however, don't find myself using Jeffrey's advice in my own code. Maybe I am too stuck in my C# world but I end up trying to make my code look like the framework code.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 515 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><code>string</code> is a reserved word, but <code>String</code> is just a class name. 
This means that <code>string</code> cannot be used as a variable name by itself.</p>

<p>If for some reason you wanted a variable called <em>string</em>, you'd see only the first of these compiles:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder String = new StringBuilder();  // compiles
StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();  // doesn't compile 
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want a variable name called <em>string</em> you can use <code>@</code> as a prefix:</p>

<pre><code>StringBuilder @string = new StringBuilder();
</code></pre>

<p>As for guidelines I wouldn't get too bogged down and just use whichever you feel like - there are more important things in life and the code is going to be the same anyway.</p>

<p>If you find yourselves building systems where it is necessary to specify the size of the integers you are using and so tend to use <code>Int16</code>, <code>Int32</code>, <code>UInt16</code>, <code>UInt32</code> etc. then it might look more natural to use <code>String</code> - and when moving around between different .net languages it might make things more understandable - otherwise I would use string and int.</p>

<p>But now for a long textual answer.</p>
<p>When we talk about <code>.NET</code> there are two different things one there is <code>.NET</code> framework and the other there are languages (<code>C#</code>, <code>VB.NET</code> etc) which use that framework.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQUcj.png" alt="enter image description here" /></p>
<p>&quot;<code>System.String</code>&quot; a.k.a &quot;String&quot; (capital &quot;S&quot;) is a <code>.NET</code> framework data type while &quot;string&quot; is a <code>C#</code> data type.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tKhjh.png" alt="enter image description here" /></p>
<p>In short &quot;String&quot; is an alias (the same thing called with different names) of &quot;string&quot;. So technically both the below code statements will give the same output.</p>
<pre><code>String s = &quot;I am String&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>string s = &quot;I am String&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>In the same way, there are aliases for other C# data types as shown below:</p>
<p>object: <code>System.Object</code>, string: <code>System.String</code>, bool: <code>System.Boolean</code>, byte: <code>System.Byte</code>, sbyte: <code>System.SByte</code>, short: <code>System.Int16</code> and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Now the million-dollar question from programmer's point of view: So when to use &quot;String&quot; and &quot;string&quot;?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing to avoid confusion use one of them consistently. But from best practices perspective when you do variable declaration it's good to use &quot;string&quot; (small &quot;s&quot;) and when you are using it as a class name then &quot;String&quot; (capital &quot;S&quot;) is preferred.</p>
<p>In the below code the left-hand side is a variable declaration and it is declared using &quot;string&quot;. On the right-hand side, we are calling a method so &quot;String&quot; is more sensible.</p>
<pre><code>string s = String.ToUpper() ;

<p>While <code>string</code> is a reserved C# keyword that always has a fixed meaning, <code>String</code> is just an ordinary <em>identifier</em> which could refer to anything. Depending on members of the current type, the current namespace and the applied <code>using</code> directives and their placement, <code>String</code> could be a value or a type distinct from <code>global::System.String</code>.</p>

<p>I shall provide two examples where <em><code>using</code> directives will not help</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>First, when <code>String</code> is a <strong><em>value</em></strong> of the current type (or a local variable):</p>

<pre><code>class MySequence&lt;TElement&gt;
{
  public IEnumerable&lt;TElement&gt; String { get; set; }

  void Example()
  {
    var test = String.Format("Hello {0}.", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above will not compile because <code>IEnumerable&lt;&gt;</code> does not have a non-static member called <code>Format</code>, and no extension methods apply. In the above case, it may still be possible to use <code>String</code> in other contexts where a <em>type</em> is the only possibility syntactically. For example <code>String local = "Hi mum!";</code> could be OK (depending on namespace and <code>using</code> directives).</p>

<p>Worse: Saying <code>String.Concat(someSequence)</code> will likely (depending on <code>using</code>s) go to the Linq extension method <code>Enumerable.Concat</code>. It will not go to the static method <code>string.Concat</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Secondly, when <code>String</code> is another <strong><em>type</em></strong>, nested inside the current type:</p>

<pre><code>class MyPiano
{
  protected class String
  {
  }

  void Example()
  {
    var test1 = String.Format("Hello {0}.", DateTime.Today.DayOfWeek);
    String test2 = "Goodbye";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Neither statement in the <code>Example</code> method compiles. Here <code>String</code> is always a piano <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(music)" rel="noreferrer">string</a>, <code>MyPiano.String</code>. No member (<code>static</code> or not) <code>Format</code> exists on it (or is inherited from its base class). And the value <code>"Goodbye"</code> cannot be converted into it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The C# language specification states, “As a matter of style, use of the keyword is favored over
  use of the complete system type name.” I disagree with the language specification; I prefer
  to use the FCL type names and completely avoid the primitive type names. In fact, I wish that
  compilers didn’t even offer the primitive type names and forced developers to use the FCL
  type names instead. Here are my reasons:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>I’ve seen a number of developers confused, not knowing whether to use <strong>string</strong>
  or <strong>String</strong> in their code. Because in C# <strong>string</strong> (a keyword) maps exactly to
  <strong>System.String</strong> (an FCL type), there is no difference and either can be used. Similarly,
  I’ve heard some developers say that <strong>int</strong> represents a 32-bit integer when the application
  is running on a 32-bit OS and that it represents a 64-bit integer when the application
  is running on a 64-bit OS. This statement is absolutely false: in C#, an <strong>int</strong> always maps
  to <strong>System.Int32</strong>, and therefore it represents a 32-bit integer regardless of the OS the
  code is running on. If programmers would use <strong>Int32</strong> in their code, then this potential
  confusion is also eliminated.</p></li>
  <li><p>In C#, <strong>long</strong> maps to <strong>System.Int64</strong>, but in a different programming language, <strong>long</strong>
  could map to an <strong>Int16</strong> or <strong>Int32</strong>. In fact, C++/CLI does treat <strong>long</strong> as an <strong>Int32</strong>.
  Someone reading source code in one language could easily misinterpret the code’s
  intention if he or she were used to programming in a different programming language.
  In fact, most languages won’t even treat <strong>long</strong> as a keyword and won’t compile code
  that uses it.</p></li>
  <li><p>The FCL has many methods that have type names as part of their method names. For
  example, the <strong>BinaryReader</strong> type offers methods such as <strong>ReadBoolean</strong>, <strong>ReadInt32</strong>,
  <strong>ReadSingle</strong>, and so on, and the <strong>System.Convert</strong> type offers methods such as
  <strong>ToBoolean</strong>, <strong>ToInt32</strong>, <strong>ToSingle</strong>, and so on. Although it’s legal to write the following
  code, the line with <strong>float</strong> feels very unnatural to me, and it’s not obvious that the line is
  correct:</p>

<pre><code>BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(...);
float val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK, but feels unnatural
Single val = br.ReadSingle(); // OK and feels good
</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Many programmers that use C# exclusively tend to forget that other programming
  languages can be used against the CLR, and because of this, C#-isms creep into the
  class library code. For example, Microsoft’s FCL is almost exclusively written in C# and
  developers on the FCL team have now introduced methods into the library such as
  <strong>Array</strong>’s <strong>GetLongLength</strong>, which returns an <strong>Int64</strong> value that is a <strong>long</strong> in C# but not
  in other languages (like C++/CLI). Another example is <strong>System.Linq.Enumerable</strong>’s
  <strong>LongCount</strong> method.</p></li>
  </ul>

<h1><code>string</code> vs. <code>String</code> is not a style debate</h1>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The keyword <code>string</code> has concrete meaning in C#. It is the type <code>System.String</code> which exists in the core runtime assembly. The runtime intrinsically understands this type and provides the capabilities developers expect for strings in .NET. Its presence is so critical to C# that if that type doesn’t exist the compiler will exit before attempting to even parse a line of code. Hence <code>string</code> has a precise, unambiguous meaning in C# code.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The identifier <code>String</code> though has no concrete meaning in C#. It is an identifier that goes through all the name lookup rules as <code>Widget</code>, <code>Student</code>, etc … It could bind to string or it could bind to a type in another assembly entirely whose purposes may be entirely different than <code>string</code>. Worse it could be defined in a way such that code like <code>String s = &quot;hello&quot;</code>; continued to compile.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>class TricksterString { 
  void Example() {
    String s = &quot;Hello World&quot;; // Okay but probably not what you expect.
  }
}

class String {
  public static implicit operator String(string s) =&gt; null;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The actual meaning of <code>String</code> will always depend on name resolution.
That means it depends on all the source files in the project and all
the types defined in all the referenced assemblies. In short it
requires quite a bit of context to <em>know</em> what it means.</p>
<p>True that in the vast majority of cases <code>String</code> and <code>string</code> will bind to
the same type. But using <code>String</code> still means developers are leaving
their program up to interpretation in places where there is only one
correct answer. When <code>String</code> does bind to the wrong type it can leave
developers debugging for hours, filing bugs on the compiler team, and
generally wasting time that could’ve been saved by using <code>string</code>.</p>
<p>Another way to visualize the difference is with this sample:</p>
<pre><code>string s1 = 42; // Errors 100% of the time  
String s2 = 42; // Might error, might not, depends on the code
</code></pre>
<p>Many will argue that while this is information technically accurate using <code>String</code> is still fine because it’s exceedingly rare that a codebase would define a type of this name. Or that when <code>String</code> is defined it’s a sign of a bad codebase.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You’ll see that <code>String</code> is defined for a number of completely valid purposes: reflection helpers, serialization libraries, lexers, protocols, etc … For any of these libraries <code>String</code> vs. <code>string</code> has real consequences depending on where the code is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So remember when you see the <code>String</code> vs. <code>string</code> debate this is about semantics, not style. Choosing string gives crisp meaning to your codebase. Choosing <code>String</code> isn’t wrong but it’s leaving the door open for surprises in the future.</p>

<p>I originally started doing this years ago, as per the CLR books by Ritchie. It made sense to me that all CLR languages ultimately have to be able to support the set of CLR types, so using the CLR types yourself provided clearer, and possibly more "reusable" code.</p>

<p>Now that I've been doing it for years, it's a habit and I like the coloration that VS shows for the CLR types.</p>

<p>The only real downer is that auto-complete uses the C# type, so I end up re-typing automatically generated types to specify the CLR type instead.</p>

  <p>All the predefined types  are mapped directly to
  underlying .NET types. The C# type names (string) are simply aliases for the
  .NET types (String or System.String), so using the .NET names works fine syntactically, although
  this is discouraged. Within a C# program, you should use the C# names
  rather than the .NET names.</p>

<p><strong>string:</strong> The string type represents a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. string is an alias for String in the .NET Framework. <code>string</code> is the intrinsic C# datatype, and is an alias for the system provided type "System.String".

<ul>
<li>The <code>string</code> is usually used for declaration while <code>String</code> is used for accessing static string methods</li>
<li>You can use <code>'string'</code> do declare fields, properties etc that use the predefined type <code>'string'</code>, since the C# specification tells me this is good style.</li>
<li>You can use <code>'String'</code> to use system-defined methods, such as String.Compare etc. They are originally defined on 'System.String', not 'string'. <code>'string'</code> is just an alias in this case.</li>
<li>You can also use <code>'String'</code> or 'System.Int32' when communicating with other system, especially if they are CLR-compliant. i.e. - if I get data from elsewhere, I'd de-serialize it into a System.Int32 rather than an 'int', if the origin by definition was something else than a C# system.</li>
