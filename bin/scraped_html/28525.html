Is it possible to tell Steam to open a game on my second monitor instead of the main monitor?</p>

<p>If that's not possible through Steam itself, is there some other way for me to control what monitor a particular game starts on? Switching to windowed mode and dragging the game over isn't always an option and I'm looking for a more robust solution.</p>
