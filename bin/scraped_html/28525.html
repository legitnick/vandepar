Is it possible to tell Steam to open a game on my second monitor instead of the main monitor?</p>

<p>If that's not possible through Steam itself, is there some other way for me to control what monitor a particular game starts on? Switching to windowed mode and dragging the game over isn't always an option and I'm looking for a more robust solution.</p>

Also very handy if you're playing in stereo 3D, since that also only works if the display used is the primary one.</p>

Here's what it can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toggle primary monitor (so that the game runs on your other monitor fullscreen)</li>
<li>Set HDMI audio playback (so that audio comes out of your TV)</li>
<li>Prevent computer sleep (so that you can play with a gamepad whose input doesn't stop sleep)</li>
<li>Darken non-game displays (so that the immersion atmosphere is maximized) </li>
<li>Launch any game executable (including Steam)</li>
<li>Revert all changes once the game exits</li>
</ul>

It'll move the window to the adjacent monitor.  You have to do it every time the game starts, but it works perfectly for me.</p>

In my case, adding <code>-sdl_displayindex 1</code> to my Dota launch options has changed which monitor the game launch on to my secondary monitor.  (Presumably my primary monitor is <code>0</code>.)</p>

There is also <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/17306/how-to-force-maximized-fullscreen-mode-in-any-game">How to force Maximized Fullscreen mode in any game?</a>.</p>

<p>With the game technically in windowed mode, you should be able to alter what monitor it is displaying on fairly easily (and possibly even use multiple monitor keyboard shortcuts and the like).</p>

All i do is switch my second monitor to the main display before starting the game then switch it back after I have finished. That way the game opens on my TV which is the usual second monitor.</p>
