<p>How do I properly delete the <code>remotes/origin/bugfix</code> branch both locally and remotely?</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 25056 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<pre><code>git push -d &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;branchname&gt;
git branch -d &lt;branchname&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In most cases, <code>&lt;remote_name&gt;</code> will be <code>origin</code>.</p>
<h1>Delete Local Branch</h1>
<p>To delete the <em><strong>local</strong></em> branch use one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt;
git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>-d</code> option is an alias for <code>--delete</code>, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch.</li>
<li>The <code>-D</code> option is an alias for <code>--delete --force</code>, which deletes the branch &quot;irrespective of its merged status.&quot; [Source: <code>man git-branch</code>]</li>
<li>As of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.3.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v2.3</a>, <code>git branch -d</code> (delete) learned to honor the <code>-f</code> (force) flag.</li>
<li>You will receive an error if you try to delete the currently selected branch.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Delete Remote Branch</h1>
<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.7.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v1.7.0</a>, you can delete a <em><strong>remote</strong></em> branch using</p>
<pre><code>$ git push &lt;remote_name&gt; --delete &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which might be easier to remember than</p>
<pre><code>$ git push &lt;remote_name&gt; :&lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which was added in <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.5.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v1.5.0</a> &quot;to delete a remote branch or a tag.&quot;</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v2.8.0</a>, you can also use <code>git push</code> with the <code>-d</code> option as an alias for <code>--delete</code>. Therefore, the version of Git you have installed will dictate whether you need to use the easier or harder syntax.</p>
<h2>Delete Remote Branch [Original Answer from 5-Jan-2010]</h2>
<p>From Chapter 3 of <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches" rel="noreferrer"><em>Pro Git</em></a> by Scott Chacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Deleting Remote Branches</h3>
<p>Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote’s main branch (or whatever branch your stable code-line is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax <code>git push [remotename] :[branch]</code>. If you want to delete your server-fix branch from the server, you run the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>$ git push origin :serverfix
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         serverfix
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Boom. No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the <code>[localbranch]</code> portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be <code>[remotebranch]</code>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I issued <code>git push origin: bugfix</code> and it worked beautifully. Scott Chacon was right—I will want to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogear#Verb" rel="noreferrer">dog ear</a> that page (or virtually dog ear by answering this on Stack Overflow).</p>
<p>Then you should execute this on other machines</p>
<pre><code># Fetch changes from all remotes and locally delete 
# remote deleted branches/tags etc
# --prune will do the job :-;
git fetch --all --prune
</code></pre>
<p>to propagate changes.</p>
