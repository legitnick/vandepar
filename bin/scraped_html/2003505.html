<p>To delete the <em><strong>local</strong></em> branch use one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -d &lt;branch_name&gt;

<ul>
<li>The <code>-d</code> option is an alias for <code>--delete</code>, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch.</li>
<li>The <code>-D</code> option is an alias for <code>--delete --force</code>, which deletes the branch &quot;irrespective of its merged status.&quot; [Source: <code>man git-branch</code>]</li>
<li>As of <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.3.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v2.3</a>, <code>git branch -d</code> (delete) learned to honor the <code>-f</code> (force) flag.</li>

<h1>Delete Remote Branch</h1>
<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.7.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v1.7.0</a>, you can delete a <em><strong>remote</strong></em> branch using</p>
<pre><code>$ git push &lt;remote_name&gt; --delete &lt;branch_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which might be easier to remember than</p>
<pre><code>$ git push &lt;remote_name&gt; :&lt;branch_name&gt;

<p>which was added in <a href="https://github.com/gitster/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/1.5.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v1.5.0</a> &quot;to delete a remote branch or a tag.&quot;</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt" rel="noreferrer">Git v2.8.0</a>, you can also use <code>git push</code> with the <code>-d</code> option as an alias for <code>--delete</code>. Therefore, the version of Git you have installed will dictate whether you need to use the easier or harder syntax.</p>
<h2>Delete Remote Branch [Original Answer from 5-Jan-2010]</h2>
<p>From Chapter 3 of <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches" rel="noreferrer"><em>Pro Git</em></a> by Scott Chacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Deleting Remote Branches</h3>
<p>Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote’s main branch (or whatever branch your stable code-line is in). You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax <code>git push [remotename] :[branch]</code>. If you want to delete your server-fix branch from the server, you run the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>$ git push origin :serverfix
To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
 - [deleted]         serverfix
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Boom. No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the <code>[localbranch]</code> portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be <code>[remotebranch]</code>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I issued <code>git push origin: bugfix</code> and it worked beautifully. Scott Chacon was right—I will want to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogear#Verb" rel="noreferrer">dog ear</a> that page (or virtually dog ear by answering this on Stack Overflow).</p>
<p>Then you should execute this on other machines</p>
<pre><code># Fetch changes from all remotes and locally delete 
# remote deleted branches/tags etc
# --prune will do the job :-;
git fetch --all --prune
</code></pre>
<p>to propagate changes.</p>

<h2>The <em>long answer</em>: there are three different branches to delete!</h2>
<p>When you're dealing with deleting branches both locally and remotely, keep in mind that <strong>there are three different branches involved</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The local branch <code>X</code>.</li>
<li>The remote origin branch <code>X</code>.</li>
<li>The local remote-tracking branch <code>origin/X</code> that tracks the remote branch <code>X</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLAqw.png" alt="Visualization of three branches" /></p>
<p>The original poster used:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -rd origin/bugfix
</code></pre>
<p>Which only deleted his <strong>local remote-tracking branch</strong> <code>origin/bugfix</code>, and not the actual remote branch <code>bugfix</code> on <code>origin</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iCOnz.png" alt="Diagram 2" /></p>
<p><strong>To delete that actual remote branch</strong>, you need</p>
<pre><code>git push origin --delete bugfix
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Z3GY.png" alt="Diagram 3" /></p>
<h3>Additional details</h3>
<p>The following sections describe additional details to consider when deleting your remote and remote-tracking branches.</p>
<h2>Pushing to delete remote branches also removes remote-tracking branches</h2>
<p>Note that deleting the remote branch <code>X</code> from the command line using a <code>git push</code> <strong>will also remove the local remote-tracking branch</strong> <code>origin/X</code>, so it is not necessary to prune the obsolete remote-tracking branch with <code>git fetch --prune</code> or <code>git fetch -p</code>. However, it wouldn't hurt if you did it anyway.</p>
<p>You can verify that the remote-tracking branch <code>origin/X</code> was also deleted by running the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code># View just remote-tracking branches
git branch --remotes
git branch -r

# View both strictly local as well as remote-tracking branches
git branch --all
git branch -a
</code></pre>
<h2>Pruning the obsolete local remote-tracking branch origin/X</h2>
<p>If you didn't delete your remote branch <code>X</code> from the command line (like above), then your local repository will still contain (a now obsolete) remote-tracking branch <code>origin/X</code>. This can happen if you deleted a remote branch directly through GitHub's web interface, for example.</p>
<p>A typical way to remove these obsolete remote-tracking branches (since Git version 1.6.6) is to simply run <code>git fetch</code> with the <code>--prune</code> or shorter <code>-p</code>. <strong>Note that this removes all obsolete local remote-tracking branches for any remote branches that no longer exist on the remote</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git fetch origin --prune
git fetch origin -p # Shorter
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the relevant quote from the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.0.0/Documentation/RelNotes/1.6.6.txt#L162-L166" rel="noreferrer">1.6.6 release notes</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;git fetch&quot; learned</strong> <code>--all</code> and <code>--multiple </code>options, to run fetch from
many repositories, and <strong><code>--prune</code> option to remove remote tracking
branches that went stale.</strong>  These make &quot;git remote update&quot; and &quot;git
remote prune&quot; less necessary (there is no plan to remove &quot;remote
update&quot; nor &quot;remote prune&quot;, though).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Alternative to above automatic pruning for obsolete remote-tracking branches</h3>
<p>Alternatively, instead of pruning your obsolete local remote-tracking branches through <code>git fetch -p</code>, <em>you can avoid making the extra network operation</em> by just manually removing the branch(es) with the <code>--remotes</code> or <code>-r</code> flags:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git branch --delete --remotes origin/X
git branch -dr origin/X # Shorter
</code></pre>

<p>For deleting the <strong>remote branch:</strong></p>

<pre><code>git push origin --delete &lt;your_branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For deleting the <strong>local branch</strong>, you have <strong>three ways</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>1: git branch -D &lt;branch_name&gt;

2: git branch --delete --force &lt;branch_name&gt;  # Same as -D

3: git branch --delete  &lt;branch_name&gt;         # Error on unmerge
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explain:</strong> OK, just explain what's going on here!</p>

<p>Simply do <code>git push origin --delete</code> to <strong>delete your remote branch <em>only</em></strong>, add the name of the branch at the end and this will delete and <strong>push it to remote</strong> at the same time...</p>

<p>Also, <code>git branch -D</code>, which simply delete the local branch <strong><em>only</em></strong>!...</p>

<p><code>-D</code> stands for <code>--delete --force</code> which will delete the branch even it's not merged (force delete), but you can also use <code>-d</code> which stands for <code>--delete</code> which throw an error respective of the branch merge status...</p>

<p>I also create the <strong>image below</strong> to show the steps:</p>

<p>only the references are deleted. Even though the branch is actually removed on the remote, the references to it still exists in the local repositories of your team members.

<p>Similarly, to delete the tag instead of the branch you would use:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin :refs/tags/branch-or-tag-name

<p>Remote pruning isn't needed if you deleted the remote branch. It's only used to get the most up-to-date remotes available on a repository you're tracking. I've observed <code>git fetch</code> will add remotes, not remove them. Here's an example of when <code>git remote prune origin</code> will actually do something:</p>

<p>User A does the steps above. User B would run the following commands to see the most up-to-date remote branches:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch
git remote prune origin
git branch -r

<p>Then every time I'm done with a branch (merged into <code>master</code>, for example) I run the following in my terminal:</p>

<pre><code>gitdelete my-branch-name

<p>From the GitHub desktop application, when you have the branch checked out, you can delete the <strong>local</strong> branch via the <em>Branch</em> menu strip:</p>

<p>If you <strong><em>are not</em></strong> using the GitHub desktop application and are using an IDE like Visual Studio for your local source control, all you have to do is a couple of quick steps:</p>

<li>Check out a branch other than the one you wish to delete.</li>
<li>Right-click the branch you wish to delete.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Delete</strong> option from the context menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, once logged in to your GitHub account online, go to the repository and click the <strong><em>All Branches</em></strong> tab.  From there, just click the little trash can icon on the right on the name of the branch you wish to delete.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 12 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The most flexible way is to use a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/10978257/244297">custom Git command</a>. For example, create the following Python script somewhere in your <code>$PATH</code> under the name <code>git-rmbranch</code> and make it executable:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import argparse
import subprocess
import sys

def rmbranch(branch_name, remote, force):
    try:
        print(subprocess.run(['git', 'branch', '-D' if force else '-d', branch_name],
                             capture_output=True, check=True, encoding='utf-8').stdout, end='')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Delete a Git branch locally and remotely.')
    parser.add_argument('-r', '--remote', default='origin', help="The remote name (defaults to 'origin')")

    args = parser.parse_args()

    sys.exit(rmbranch(args.branch_name, args.remote, args.force))
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>git rmbranch -h</code> will show you usage information:</p>

<pre><code>usage: git-rmbranch [-h] [-r REMOTE] [-f] branch_name

Delete a Git branch locally and remotely.

positional arguments:
  branch_name           The branch name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r REMOTE, --remote REMOTE
                        The remote name (defaults to 'origin')
  -f, --force           Force deletion of not fully merged branches
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>git push origin --delete &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> also removes the local remote-tracking branch (<code>origin/&lt;branch_name&gt;</code> by default), so no need to care about that.</p>

I went back and forth between the two trying to understand the better approach to support a submodule replacement. Below is a combination of them.</p>

<p>First navigate Git Bash to the root of the Git repository to be split. In my example here that is <code>~/Documents/OriginalRepo (master)</code></p>

<pre><code># Move the folder at prefix to a new branch
git subtree split --prefix=SubFolderName/FolderToBeNewRepo --branch=to-be-new-repo

# Create a new repository out of the newly made branch
mkdir ~/Documents/NewRepo
pushd ~/Documents/NewRepo
git init
git pull ~/Documents/OriginalRepo to-be-new-repo

# Upload the new repository to a place that should be referenced for submodules
git remote add origin git@github.com:myUsername/newRepo.git
git push -u origin master
popd

# Replace the folder with a submodule
git rm -rf ./SubFolderName/FolderToBeNewRepo
git submodule add git@github.com:myUsername/newRepo.git SubFolderName/FolderToBeNewRepo
git branch --delete --force to-be-new-repo
</code></pre>

<p>Below is a copy of above with the customize-able names replaced and using HTTPS instead. The root folder is now <code>~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoProject (master)</code></p>

git subtree split --prefix=Assets/SoArchitecture --branch=so-package

# Create a new repository out of the newly made branch
mkdir ~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoArchitecture
pushd ~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoArchitecture
git init
git pull ~/Documents/_Shawn/UnityProjects/SoProject so-package

# Upload the new repository to a place that should be referenced for submodules
git remote add origin https://github.com/Feddas/SoArchitecture.git
git push -u origin master
popd

# Replace the folder with a submodule
git rm -rf ./Assets/SoArchitecture
git submodule add https://github.com/Feddas/SoArchitecture.git
git branch --delete --force so-package
