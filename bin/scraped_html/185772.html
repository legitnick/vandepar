It's called a perfect game and it was achieved by 3 different people already.</p>

<p>What I want to know is: <strong>WHY is it exactly 3333360 points?</strong> It must be a technical limitation, but this number makes no sense in my opinion.</p>

<p>I know the game has 255 levels. 255 is <code>11111111</code> in binary and level 256 (that seems to exist mystically) brings the 8-bit digit to an overflow, which ends in a crash of the game.</p>

<p>But, 3333360 just seems so random.</p>
