<p>I would like to show a small clip from a long video  file that is over 10 minutes long.  This  segment  of video  would start at time offset /seek time of 90 seconds and would have a duration  of 45 seconds . How can I do that  ? </p>

<p>HTML5 video also supports the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/" rel="noreferrer">Media Fragment URI</a> spec. This will allow you to specify only a segment of the video to play. Using it is fairly trivial:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;source src="video.mp4#t=30,45" type="video/mp4"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Will start the video at the 30 second mark and pause the video at the 45 second mark.</p>

<p>Phillip Brown is right. you can solve this by controlling yout html-player via js. for example in this case, the video would autostart and will play the videofile should 00:10min to 00:40min</p>

<pre><code>&lt;video id="yourVideoplayer" width="640" height="480" preload="auto"&gt; //preload="auto" buffers the video if initialize. you cannot seek a video which isn t buffering already
  &lt;source src="test.mp4" type="video/mp4" /&gt;
  &lt;source src="test.ogv" type="video/ogg" /&gt; 
  This browser is not compatible with HTML 5
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
   window.onload = playVideoTeaserFrom(10,40);   //this event will call the function after page was loaded

   function playVideoTeaserFrom (startTime, endTime) {
       var videoplayer = document.getElementById("yourVideoplayer");  //get your videoplayer

       videoplayer.currentTime = starttime; //not sure if player seeks to seconds or milliseconds
       videoplayer.play();

       //call function to stop player after given intervall
       var stopVideoAfter = (endTime - startTime) * 1000;  //* 1000, because Timer is in ms
       setTimeout(function(){
           videoplayer.stop();
       }, stopVideoAfter);

   }
 &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>there might be some bugs in it, but i guess you ll get the point</p>
