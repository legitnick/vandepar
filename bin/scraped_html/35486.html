I got drunk and trashed a temple. How do I pick up the mess?</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>After getting shouted at rather intensely by four old guys on the top of a "7000 steps" tall mountain, I decided it was time to go home to Whiterun and have a couple cups of mead. </p>

<p>Fortunately I found the right drinking buddy at the inn by the marketplace. He greeted me by offering me a drinking challenge. Who am I to say no? Well... as you can already guess, no good story starts with "that night when I decided not to drink...". </p>

<p>A couple of drinks later I woke up on the other side of Skyrim in a temple inside Markarth and was greeted by a priestess of the temple. My drinking buddy and the staff that he promised me for winning the drinking contest were nowhere to be found. Also, apparently I made a mess off the temple and now need to clean up. </p>

<p>I looked around and picked up everything that is on the floor, but when I try to talk to her she still says "Talk to me again when you picked up the mess that you made". What do I have to do now?</p>
