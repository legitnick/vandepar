<p>In old versions of Git, the above commands are equivalent to <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> and <code>git reset HEAD</code> respectively, and will fail if <code>HEAD</code> is undefined (because you haven't yet made any commits in your repository) or ambiguous (because you created a branch called <code>HEAD</code>, which is a stupid thing that you shouldn't do). This <a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/RelNotes/1.8.2.txt#n179" rel="noreferrer">was changed in Git 1.8.2</a>, though, so in modern versions of Git you can use the commands above even prior to making your first commit:</p>

you do not have any commits in your history, but it now gives you

<pre><code>git rm --cached &lt;added_file_to_undo&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Reasoning:</p>

<p>When I was new to this, I first tried</p>

<pre><code>git reset .
</code></pre>

<p>(to undo my entire initial add), only to get this (not so) helpful message:</p>

<pre><code>fatal: Failed to resolve 'HEAD' as a valid ref.
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that this is because the HEAD ref (branch?) doesn't exist until after the first commit. That is, you'll run into the same beginner's problem as me if your workflow, like mine, was something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>cd to my great new project directory to try out Git, the new hotness</li>
<li><code>git init</code></li>
<li><code>git add .</code></li>
<li><p><code>git status</code></p>

<p>... lots of crap scrolls by ...</p>

<p>=> Damn, I didn't want to add all of that.</p></li>
<li><p>google "undo git add"</p>

<p>=> find Stack Overflow - yay</p></li>
<li><p><code>git reset .</code></p>

<p>=>    fatal: Failed to resolve 'HEAD' as a valid ref.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It further turns out that there's <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git/2008/2/13/846664/thread" rel="noreferrer">a bug logged</a> against the unhelpfulness of this in the mailing list.</p>

<p>And that the correct solution was right there in the Git status output (which, yes, I glossed over as 'crap)</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>...
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
...
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And the solution indeed is to use <code>git rm --cached FILE</code>.</p>

<p>Note the warnings elsewhere here - <code>git rm</code> deletes your local working copy of the file, but <em>not</em> if you use <strong>--cached</strong>.  Here's the result of <code>git help rm</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>--cached
      Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index.
      Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I proceed to use</p>

<pre><code>git rm --cached .
</code></pre>

<p>to remove everything and start again. Didn't work though, because while <code>add .</code> is recursive, turns out <code>rm</code> needs <code>-r</code> to recurse. Sigh.</p>

<pre><code>git rm -r --cached .
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, now I'm back to where I started. Next time I'm going to use <code>-n</code> to do a dry run and see what will be added:</p>

<pre><code>git add -n .
</code></pre>

<p>I zipped up everything to a safe place before trusting <code>git help rm</code> about the <code>--cached</code> not destroying anything (and what if I misspelled it).</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 298 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>To clarify: <code>git add</code> moves changes from the current working directory to the <em>staging area</em> (index).</p>

<p>This process is called <em>staging</em>. So the most natural command to <em>stage</em> the changes (changed files) is the obvious one:</p>

<pre><code>git stage
</code></pre>

<p><code>git add</code> is just an easier-to-type alias for <code>git stage</code></p>

<p>Pity there is no <code>git unstage</code> nor <code>git unadd</code> commands. The relevant one is harder to guess or remember, but it is pretty obvious:</p>

<pre><code>git reset HEAD --
</code></pre>

<p>We can easily create an alias for this:</p>

<pre><code>git config --global alias.unadd 'reset HEAD --'
git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, we have new commands:</p>

<pre><code>git add file1
git stage file2
git unadd file2
git unstage file1
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I use even shorter aliases:</p>

<pre><code>git a # For staging
git u # For unstaging
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 209 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>An addition to the accepted answer, if your mistakenly-added file was huge, you'll probably notice that, even after removing it from the index with '<code>git reset</code>', it still seems to occupy space in the <code>.git</code> directory.</p>

<p>This is nothing to be worried about; the file is indeed still in the repository, but only as a "loose object". It will not be copied to other repositories (via clone, push), and the space will be eventually reclaimed - though perhaps not very soon. If you are anxious, you can run:</p>

<pre><code>git gc --prune=now
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><em>Update</em> (what follows is my attempt to clear some confusion that can arise from the most upvoted answers):</p>

<p>So, which is the real <strong>undo</strong> of <code>git add</code>?</p>

<p><code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> ?</p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, and if I'm not mistaken: <strong>none</strong>.</p>

<p><code>git add</code> <strong>cannot be undone</strong> - safely, in general.</p>

<p>Let's recall first what <code>git add &lt;file&gt;</code> actually does:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> was <strong>not previously tracked</strong>, <code>git add</code>  <strong>adds it to the cache</strong>, with its current content.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> was <strong>already tracked</strong>, <code>git add</code>  <strong>saves the current content</strong> (snapshot, version) to the cache. In Git, this action is still called <strong>add</strong>, (not mere <em>update</em> it), because two different versions (snapshots) of a file are regarded as two different items: hence, we are indeed adding a new item to the cache, to be eventually committed later.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In light of this, the question is slightly ambiguous:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mistakenly added files using the command...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OP's scenario seems to be the first one (untracked file),  we want the "undo" to remove the file (not just the current contents) from the tracked items. <strong>If</strong> this is the case, then it's ok to run  <code>git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>And we could also run <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code>. This is in general preferable, because it works in both scenarios: it also does the undo when we wrongly added a version of an already tracked item.</p>

<p>But there are two caveats.</p>

<p>First: There is (as pointed out in the answer) only one scenario in which <code>git reset HEAD</code> doesn't work, but <code>git rm --cached</code> does: a new repository (no commits). But, really, this a practically irrelevant case.</p>

<p>Second: Be aware that <code>git reset HEAD</code>  can't magically recover the previously cached file contents, it just resynchronises it from the HEAD. If our misguided <code>git add</code> overwrote a previous staged uncommitted version, we can't recover it. That's why, strictly speaking, we cannot undo [*].</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$ git init
$ echo "version 1" &gt; file.txt
$ git add file.txt   # First add of file.txt
$ git commit -m 'first commit'
$ echo "version 2" &gt; file.txt
$ git add  file.txt   # Stage (don't commit) "version 2" of file.txt
$ git diff --cached file.txt
-version 1
+version 2
$ echo "version 3" &gt; file.txt
$ git diff  file.txt
-version 2
+version 3
$ git add  file.txt    # Oops we didn't mean this
$ git reset HEAD file.txt  # Undo?
$ git diff --cached file.txt  # No dif, of course. stage == HEAD
$ git diff file.txt   # We have irrevocably lost "version 2"
-version 1
+version 3
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is not very critical if we just follow the usual lazy workflow of doing 'git add' only for adding new files (case 1), and we update new contents via the commit, <code>git commit -a</code> command.</p>

* (Edit: the above is practically correct, but still there can be some slightly hackish/convoluted ways for recovering changes that were staged, but not committed and then overwritten - see the comments by Johannes Matokic and iolsmit)

With the <code>--staged</code> flag, it restores the content of the index (what is asked here).</p>
<p>When running <code>git status</code> with staged uncommitted file(s), this is now what Git suggests to use to unstage file(s) (instead of <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> as it used to prior to v2.23).</p>

<p>Choose option 3 to un add files. In my case I often want to add more than one file, and with interactive mode you can use numbers like this to add files. This will take all but 4: 1, 2, 3, and 5</p>

<p>To choose a sequence, just type 1-5 to take all from 1 to 5.</p>

<p>so, you will be in the previous state. Specified will be again in untracked list (previous state).</p>

You can check which command Sourcetree uses to unstage a file.</p>

<p>I created a new file and added it to Git. Then I unstaged it using the Sourcetree GUI.
This is the result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unstaging files [08/12/15 10:43]
  git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false -c credential.helper=sourcetree reset -q -- path/to/file/filename.java</p>

<p>Sourcetree uses <code>reset</code> to unstage new files.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 9 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><pre><code>git add -A
</code></pre>
<p>is used to add all files to your commit (stage).</p>
<pre><code>git reset
</code></pre>
<p>is the opposite of 'git add -A' command. It removes all the files that are staged(means ready) to be committed.</p>
<p>Likewise, to add a specific file to commit we use <code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code>
Same way, to unstage(or reset) a specific file that we added using <code>git add</code> we use <code>git reset &lt;filename&gt;</code> .</p>
<p>git reset is the exact opposite of git add.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 7 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The <code>git reset</code> command helps you to modify either the staging area or the staging area and working tree. Git's ability to craft commits exactly like you want means that you sometimes need to undo changes to the changes you staged with <code>git add</code>.</p>

<p>You can do that by calling <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file to change&gt;</code>. You have two options to get rid of changes completely. <code>git checkout HEAD &lt;file(s) or path(s)&gt;</code> is a quick way to undo changes to your staging area and working tree.</p>

<p>Be careful with this command, however, because it removes all changes to your working tree. Git doesn't know about those changes since they've never been committed. There's no way to get those changes back once you run this command.</p>

<p>Another command at your disposal is <code>git reset --hard</code>. It is equally destructive to your working tree - any uncommitted changes or staged changes are lost after running it. Running <code>git reset -hard HEAD</code> does the same thing as <code>git checkout HEAD</code>. It just does not require a file or path to work.</p>

<p>You can use <code>--soft</code> with <code>git reset</code>. It resets the repository to the commit you specify and stages all of those changes. Any changes you have already staged are not affected, nor are the changes in your working tree.</p>

<p>Finally, you can use <code>--mixed</code> to reset the working tree without staging any changes. This also unstages any changes that are staged.</p>

<p>You can also use <code>git rm --cached</code>, however, the <code>git rm</code> command should be ideally used for already tracked files.</p>
