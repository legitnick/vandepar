<h2>Original answer</h2>
<p>This article about Javascript Strict Mode might interest you: <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/" rel="noreferrer">John Resig - ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, JSON, and More</a></p>
<p>To quote some interesting parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a &quot;strict&quot; operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.</li>
<li>It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively &quot;unsafe&quot; actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).</li>
<li>It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also note you can apply &quot;strict mode&quot; to the whole file... Or you can use it only for a specific function <em>(still quoting from John Resig's article)</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>// Non-strict code...

(function(){
  &quot;use strict&quot;;

  // Define your library strictly...
})();

// Non-strict code...
</code></pre>
<p>Which might be helpful if you have to mix old and new code ;-)</p>
<p>So, I suppose it's a bit like the <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/strict" rel="noreferrer"><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code></a> you can use in Perl <em>(hence the name?)</em>: it helps you make fewer errors, by detecting more things that could lead to breakages.</p>
<p>Strict mode is now <a href="http://caniuse.com/use-strict" rel="noreferrer">supported by all major browsers</a>.</p>

<p>It's just a string you put in your JavaScript files (either at the top of your file or inside of a function) that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>"use strict";

<p>Putting it in your code now shouldn't cause any problems with current browsers as it's just a string. It may cause problems with your code in the future if your code violates the pragma.

This thing is not some feel-good, happy-face sticker that you can slap on the code to make it 'better'.  With the <code>"use strict"</code> pragma, the browser will suddenly THROW exceptions in random places that it never threw before just because at that spot you are doing something that default/loose JavaScript happily allows but strict JavaScript abhors!  You may have strictness violations hiding in seldom used calls in your code that will only throw an exception when they do eventually get run - say, in the production environment that your paying customers use!</p>

<p>If you are going to take the plunge, it is a good idea to apply <code>"use strict"</code> alongside comprehensive unit tests and a strictly configured JSHint build task that will give you some confidence that there is no dark corner of your module that will blow up horribly just because you've turned on Strict Mode.  Or, hey, here's another option:  just don't add <code>"use strict"</code> to any of your legacy code, it's probably safer that way, honestly.  <strong>DEFINITELY DO NOT</strong> add <code>"use strict"</code> to any modules you do not own or maintain, like third party modules.</p>

<p>I think even though it is a deadly caged animal, <code>"use strict"</code> can be good stuff, but you have to do it right.  The best time to go strict is when your project is greenfield and you are starting from scratch. Configure <code>JSHint/JSLint</code> with all the warnings and options cranked up as tight as your team can stomach, get a good build/test/assert system du jour rigged like <code>Grunt+Karma+Chai</code>, and only THEN start marking all your new modules as <code>"use strict"</code>.  Be prepared to cure lots of niggly errors and warnings.  Make sure everyone understands the gravity by configuring the build to FAIL if <code>JSHint/JSLint</code> produces any violations.</p>

<p>My project was not a greenfield project when I adopted <code>"use strict"</code>.  As a result, my IDE is full of red marks because I don't have <code>"use strict"</code> on half my modules, and JSHint complains about that.  It's a reminder to me about what refactoring I should do in the future.  My goal is to be red mark free due to all of my missing <code>"use strict"</code> statements, but that is years away now.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 249 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><h1>Using <code>'use strict';</code> does not suddenly make your code better.</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript strict mode</a> is a feature in <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" rel="noreferrer">ECMAScript 5</a>. You can enable the strict mode by declaring this in the top of your script/function.</p>
<pre><code>'use strict';
</code></pre>
<p>When a JavaScript engine sees this <em>directive</em>, it will start to interpret the code in a special mode. In this mode, errors are thrown up when certain coding practices that could end up being potential bugs are detected (which is the reasoning behind the strict mode).</p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code>var a = 365;
var b = 030;
</code></pre>
<p>In their obsession to line up the numeric literals, the developer has inadvertently initialized variable <code>b</code> with an octal literal. Non-strict mode will interpret this as a numeric literal with value <code>24</code> (in base 10). However, strict mode will throw an error.</p>

<h2>Where should I use <code>'use strict';</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In my <em>new</em> JavaScript application: <strong>Absolutely!</strong> Strict mode can be used as a whistleblower when you are doing something stupid with your code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my <em>existing</em> JavaScript code: <strong>Probably not!</strong> If your existing JavaScript code has statements that are prohibited in strict-mode, the application will simply break. If you want strict mode, you should be prepared to debug and correct your existing code. This is why <em>using <code>'use strict';</code> does not suddenly make your code better</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>How do I use strict mode?</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your script:</p>
<pre><code> // File: myscript.js

 'use strict';
 var a = 2;
 ....
</code></pre>
<p>Note that everything in the file <code>myscript.js</code> will be interpreted in strict mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Or, insert a <code>'use strict';</code> statement on top of your function body:</p>
<pre><code> function doSomething() {
     'use strict';
     ...
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Everything in the <em>lexical scope</em> of function <code>doSomething</code> will be interpreted in strict mode. The word <em>lexical scope</em> is important here. For example, if your <em>strict</em> code calls a function of a library that is <em>not strict</em>, only your code is executed in strict mode, and not the called function. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6039163/1461424">this answer</a> for a better explanation.</p>

<h2>What things are prohibited in strict mode?</h2>
<p>I found a <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2010/12/14/strict-mode-is-coming-to-town/" rel="noreferrer">nice article</a> describing several things that are prohibited in strict mode (note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>Historically, JavaScript has been confused about how functions
are scoped. Sometimes they seem to be statically scoped, but some
features make them behave like they are dynamically scoped. This is
confusing, making programs difficult to read and understand.
Misunderstanding causes bugs. It also is a problem for performance.
Static scoping would permit variable binding to happen at compile
time, but the requirement for dynamic scope means the binding must be
deferred to runtime, which comes with a significant performance
penalty.</p>
<p>Strict mode requires that all variable binding be done statically.
That means that the features that previously required dynamic binding
must be eliminated or modified. Specifically, the with statement is
eliminated, and the eval function’s ability to tamper with the
environment of its caller is severely restricted.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of strict code is that tools like <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/" rel="noreferrer">YUI Compressor</a>
can do a better job when processing it.</p>
<h2>Implied Global Variables</h2>
<p>JavaScript has implied global variables. If
you do not explicitly declare a variable, a global variable is
implicitly declared for you. This makes programming easier for
beginners because they can neglect some of their basic housekeeping
chores. But it makes the management of larger programs much more
difficult and it significantly degrades reliability. So in strict
mode, implied global variables are no longer created. You should
explicitly declare all of your variables.</p>
<h2>Global Leakage</h2>
<p>There are a number of situations that could cause <code>this</code>
to be bound to the global object. For example, if you forget to
provide the <code>new</code> prefix when calling a constructor function, the
constructor's <code>this</code> will be bound unexpectedly to the global object, so
instead of initializing a new object, it will instead be silently
tampering with global variables. In these situations, strict mode will
instead bind <code>this</code> to <code>undefined</code>, which will cause the constructor to
throw an exception instead, allowing the error to be detected much
sooner.</p>
<h2>Noisy Failure</h2>
<p>JavaScript has always had read-only properties, but you
could not create them yourself until ES5’s <code>Object.createProperty</code>
function exposed that capability. If you attempted to assign a value
to a read-only property, it would fail silently. The assignment would
not change the property’s value, but your program would proceed as
though it had. This is an integrity hazard that can cause programs to
go into an inconsistent state. In strict mode, attempting to change a
read-only property will throw an exception.</p>
<h2>Octal</h2>
<p>The octal (or base 8) representation of numbers was extremely
useful when doing machine-level programming on machines whose word
sizes were a multiple of 3. You needed octal when working with the CDC
6600 mainframe, which had a word size of 60 bits. If you could read
octal, you could look at a word as 20 digits. Two digits represented
the op code, and one digit identified one of 8 registers. During the
slow transition from machine codes to high level languages, it was
thought to be useful to provide octal forms in programming languages.</p>
<p>In C, an extremely unfortunate representation of octalness was
selected: Leading zero. So in C, <code>0100</code> means 64, not 100, and <code>08</code> is an
error, not 8. Even more unfortunately, this anachronism has been
copied into nearly all modern languages, including JavaScript, where
it is only used to create errors. It has no other purpose. So in
strict mode, octal forms are no longer allowed.</p>
<h2>Et cetera</h2>
<p>The arguments pseudo array becomes a little bit more
array-like in ES5. In strict mode, it loses its <code>callee</code> and <code>caller</code>
properties. This makes it possible to pass your <code>arguments</code> to untrusted
code without giving up a lot of confidential context. Also, the
<code>arguments</code> property of functions is eliminated.</p>
<p>In strict mode, duplicate keys in a function literal will produce a
syntax error. A function can’t have two parameters with the same name.
A function can’t have a variable with the same name as one of its
parameters. A function can’t <code>delete</code> its own variables. An attempt to
<code>delete</code> a non-configurable property now throws an exception. Primitive
values are not implicitly wrapped.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Reserved words for future JavaScript versions</h2>
<p>ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words. If you use them as variables or arguments, strict mode will throw an error. The reserved words are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>implements</code>, <code>interface</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>package</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>yield</code></p>
</blockquote>

There are enough browsers supporting it that strict mode will legitimately help save us from errors we didn’t even know were in your code.</p>

<p>Apparently, at the initial stage there will be errors we have never encountered before. To get the full benefit, we need to do proper testing after switching to strict mode to make sure we have caught everything. Definitely we don’t just throw <code>use strict</code> in our code and assume there are no errors. So the churn is that it’s time to start using this incredibly useful language feature to write better code.</p>

<p><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>Directives are similar to statements, yet different.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>use strict</code> does not contain key words: The directive is a simple expression statement, which consists of a special string literal (in single or double quotes). JavaScript engines, that do not implement ECMAScript 5, merely see an expression statement without side effects. It is expected that future versions of ECMAScript standards introduce <code>use</code> as a real key word; the quotes would thereby become obsolete.</li>
<li><code>use strict</code> can be used only at the beginning of a script or of a function, i.e. it must precede every other (real) statement. It does not have to be the first instruction in a script of function: it can be preceded by other statement expressions that consist of string literals ( and JavaScript implementations can treat them as implementation specific directives). String literals statements, which follow a first real statement (in a script or function) are simple expression statements. Interpreters must not interpret them as directives and they have no effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>use strict</code> directive indicates that the following code (in a script or a function) is strict code.
The code in the highest level of a script (code that is not in a function) is considered strict code when the script contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
The content of a function is considered strict code when the function itself is defined in a strict code or when the function contains a <code>use strict</code> directive.
Code that is passed to an <code>eval()</code> method is considered strict code when <code>eval()</code> was called from a strict code or contains the <code>use strict</code> directive itself.</p>
<p>The strict mode of ECMAScript 5 is a restricted subset of the JavaScript language, which eliminates relevant deficits of the language and features more stringent error checking and higher security. The following lists the differences between strict mode and normal mode (of which the first three are particularly important):</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use the <code>with</code>-statement in strict mode.</li>
<li>In strict mode all variables have to be declared: if you assign a value to an identifier that has not been declared as variable, function, function parameter, catch-clause parameter or property of the global <code>Object</code>, then you will get a <code>ReferenceError</code>. In normal mode the identifier is implicitly declared as a global variable (as a property of the global <code>Object</code>)</li>
<li>In strict mode the keyword <code>this</code> has the value <code>undefined</code> in functions that were invoked as functions (not as methods). (In normal mode <code>this</code> always points to the global <code>Object</code>). This difference can be used to test if an implementation supports the strict mode:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>var hasStrictMode = (function() { &quot;use strict&quot;; return this===undefined }());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Also when a function is invoked with <code>call()</code> or <code>apply</code> in strict mode, then <code>this</code> is exactly the value of the first argument of the <code>call()</code>or <code>apply()</code> invocation. (In normal mode <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are replaced by the global <code>Object</code> and values, which are not objects, are cast into objects.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code>, when you try to assign to readonly properties or to define new properties for a non extensible object. (In normal mode both simply fail without error message.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode, when passing code to <code>eval()</code>, you cannot declare or define variables or functions in the scope of the caller (as you can do it in normal mode). Instead, a new scope is created for <code>eval()</code> and the variables and functions are within that scope. That scope is destroyed after <code>eval()</code> finishes execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the arguments-object of a function contains a static copy of the values, which are passed to that function. In normal mode the arguments-object has a somewhat &quot;magical&quot; behaviour: The elements of the array and the named function parameters reference both the same value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>SyntaxError</code> when the <code>delete</code> operator is followed by a non qualified identifier (a variable, function or function parameter). In normal mode the <code>delete</code> expression would do nothing and is evaluated to <code>false</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode you will get a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to delete a non configurable property. (In normal mode the attempt simply fails and the <code>delete</code> expression is evaluated to <code>false</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when you try to define several properties with the same name for an object literal. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode it is considered a syntactical error when a function declaration has multiple parameters with the same name. (In normal mode there is no error.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode octal literals are not allowed (these are literals that start with <code>0</code>. (In normal mode some implementations do allow octal literals.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode the identifiers <code>eval</code> and <code>arguments</code> are treated like keywords. You cannot change their value, cannot assign a value to them, and you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, function parameters or identifiers of a catch block.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In strict mode are more restrictions on the possibilities to examine the call stack. <code>arguments.caller</code> and <code>arguments.callee</code> cause a <code>TypeError</code> in a function in strict mode. Furthermore, some caller- and arguments properties of functions in strict mode cause a <code>TypeError</code> when you try to read them.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the goals of strict mode is to allow for faster debugging of issues. It helps the developers by throwing exception when certain wrong things occur that can cause silent &amp; strange behaviour of your webpage. The moment we use <code> use strict</code>, the code will throw out errors which helps developer to fix it in advance.</p>

<p>Worse, since the developer is in normal mode, they don’t have the advantages of extra errors being thrown, so the error might fail silently.</p>

<p>Also, as listed above, strict mode stops you from doing certain things.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>JavaScript was designed and implemented hastily because of the browser wars and bad management. As a result many poor design decisions, un-intuitive syntax and confusing semantics found their way into the language. Strict mode aims to amend some of these mistakes.</p>
<p>But fixing these mistakes without creating alternative interpretation breaks backward compatibility. So, <code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code> directive creates that alternative interpretation of the code while communicating it to the programmer.</p>
<p>For example, <code>this</code> keywords refers to the object in a method definition, like <code>this</code> or <code>self</code> in other languages.</p>
<pre><code>let o = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  sayName: function(){
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

o.sayName(); // 'John Doe'
</code></pre>
<p><code>this</code> has no purpose outside the method context but all JavaScript functions have <code>this</code> keyword whether they are methods or not:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function run() {
  console.log(this);
}

run(); // Window
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>this</code> resolves to the global object which does not make sense and serves no purpose because global object is already available in the scope.</p>
<p>In strict mode <code>this</code> in a global function resolves to undefined, which is what we expect.</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>&quot;use strict&quot;

function run() {
  console.log(this);
}

run(); // undefined
</code></pre>
<p>Some mistakes can not be fixed even in strict mode because syntax should be valid for older browsers since they ignore <code>&quot;strict mode&quot;</code> directive. This is by design.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><strong>Strict mode can prevent memory leaks.</strong></p>

<p>Please check the function below written in non-strict mode:</p>

<pre><code>function getname(){
    name = "Stack Overflow"; // Not using var keyword
    return name;
}
getname();
console.log(name); // Stack Overflow
</code></pre>

<p>In this function, we are using a variable called <code>name</code> inside the function. Internally, the compiler will first check if there is any variable declared with that particular name in that particular function scope. Since the compiler understood that there is no such variable, it will check in the outer scope. In our case, it is the global scope. Again, the compiler understood that there is also no variable declared in the global space with that name, so it creates such a variable for us in the global space. Conceptually, this variable will be created in the global scope and will be available in the entire application.</p>

<p>Another scenario is that, say, the variable is declared in a child function. In that case, the compiler checks the validity of that variable in the outer scope, i.e., the parent function. Only then it will check in the global space and create a variable for us there.
That means additional checks need to be done. This will affect the performance of the application.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now let's write the same function in strict mode.</p>

<pre><code>"use strict"
function getname(){
    name = "Stack Overflow"; // Not using var keyword
    return name;
}
getname();
console.log(name); 
</code></pre>

<p>We will get the following error.</p>

<pre><code>Uncaught ReferenceError: name is not defined
at getname (&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:15)
at &lt;anonymous&gt;:6:5
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the compiler throws the reference error. In strict mode, the compiler does not allow us to use the variable without declaring it. So memory leaks can be prevented. In addition, we can write more optimized code.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it considered among best practices?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, It's considered part of the best practices while working with javascript to include <em>Strict mode</em>. This is done by adding the below line of code in your JS file.</p>
<p><code>'use strict'; </code></p>
<p>in your code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to user agents?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indicating that code should be interpreted in strict mode specifies to user agents like browsers that they should treat code literally as written, and throw an error if the code doesn't make sense.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> Consider in your <code>.js</code> file you have the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>var city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: [NO STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Prints the city name, i.e. Chicago
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>So why does the variable name is being printed in both cases?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without strict mode turned on, user agents often go through a series of modifications to problematic code in an attempt to get it to make sense. On the surface, this can seem like a fine thing, and indeed, working outside of strict mode makes it possible for people to get their feet wet with JavaScript code without having all the details quite nailed down. However, as a developer, I don't want to leave a bug in my code, because I know it could come back and bite me later on, and I also just want to write good code. And that's where strict mode helps out.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: [STRICT MODE]</strong></p>
<pre><code>'use strict';

city = &quot;Chicago&quot;
console.log(city) // Reference Error: asignment is undeclared variable city.
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Additional tip:</strong></em> To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don't need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple <code>.js</code> file. You can enforce this rule globally in <code>eslint</code> rules as follows:</p>
<p><em>Filename:</em> <code>.eslintrc.js</code></p>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
    env: {
        es6: true
    },
    rules : {
        strict: ['error', 'global'],
        },
    };
    
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so what is prevented in strict mode?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Using a variable without declaring it</em> will throw an error in strict mode. This is to prevent unintentionally creating global variables throughout your application. The example with printing Chicago covers this in particular.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Deleting a variable or a function or an argument</em> is a no-no in strict mode.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;use strict&quot;;
 function x(p1, p2) {}; 
 delete x; // This will cause an error
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><em>Duplicating a parameter name</em> is <strong>not</strong> allowed in strict mode.</p>
<pre><code> &quot;use strict&quot;;
 function x(p1, p1) {};   // This will cause an error
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><em>Reserved words in the Javascript language are not allowed</em> in strict mode. The words are implements interface, let, packages, private, protected, public. static, and yield</p>
</li>
</ul>
