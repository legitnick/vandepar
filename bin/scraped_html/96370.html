When I was installing a first game (Warhammer 40000), I've chosen to place my library folder on drive <code>D:</code> and the game went there.</p>

<p>But now as I've got installed the second game (Portal), I can see that it was put on drive <code>C:</code> despite to the choice I've done previously. When I open Steam - Settings - Downloads + Cloud - Steam library folders, I can see both installation places in the list. Can I merge them into one?</p>

<p>I would even agree to use the default drive <code>C:</code> library (as I've replaced it with a symlink already). When I press to remove one library it says it can only remove empty ones.</p>
