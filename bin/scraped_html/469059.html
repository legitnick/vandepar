<li><a href="http://www.peterbe.com/plog/button-tag-in-IE" rel="noreferrer">And another page</a> describing why people avoid <code>&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> (Hint: IE6)</li>

<p>Another IE problem when using <code>&lt;button /&gt;</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And while we're talking about IE, it's
  got a couple of bugs related to the
  width of buttons. It'll mysteriously
  add extra padding when you're trying
  to add styles, meaning you have to add
  a tiny hack to get things under
  control.</p>

Thus, another reason to use <code>&lt;input type="button"&gt;</code> (or <code>&lt;button type="button"&gt;</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - <em>more details</em></p>

<p>Without a type, <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/button" rel="noreferrer"><code>button</code> implicitly receives type of <code>submit</code></a>. It does not matter how many submit buttons or inputs there are in the form, any one of them which is explicitly or implicitly typed as submit, when clicked, will submit the form.</p>

<p>There are 3 supported types for a button</p>

<pre><code>submit ||  "submits the form when clicked (default)"
reset  ||  "resets the fields in the form when clicked"
button ||  "clickable, but without any event handler until one is assigned"
</code></pre>

<p>From the page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Buttons created with the BUTTON element function just like buttons
  created with the INPUT element, but
  they offer richer rendering
  possibilities: the BUTTON element may
  have content. For example, a BUTTON
  element that contains an image
  functions like and may resemble an
  INPUT element whose type is set to
  “image”, but the BUTTON element type
  allows content.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button type="button"&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This is the difference between this element and buttons created with the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Important: If you use the button element in an HTML form, different browsers will submit different values. Internet Explorer will submit the text between the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/button&gt;</code> tags, while other browsers will submit the content of the value attribute. Use the input element to create buttons in an HTML form.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, the answer is compatibility and input consistency from browser to browser</p>
