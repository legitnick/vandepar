<p>I want to drop a sheep from <code>n</code> blocks high so that I have a delay before the trap is triggered. The timing needs to be very exact, but I don't know how the falling mechanism works: whether there is acceleration, and how fast it is hit. (I understand this would be different for a chicken.)</p>
<p>Can someone give me some figures of the length of time it takes to reach the terminal velocity, and how many blocks per second a mob will fall at terminal velocity?</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 148 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Falling speed is explained in the &quot;<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Transportation#Vertical_speeds" rel="noreferrer">Transportation</a>&quot; page on the wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every tick (1/20 second), non-flying players and mobs have their vertical speed decremented (less upward motion, more downward motion) by 0.08 blocks per tick (1.6 m/s), then multiplied by 0.98. This would produce a terminal velocity of 3.92 blocks per tick, or 78.4 m/s.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Terminal Velocity</h2>
<p>As stated above, terminal velocity in Minecraft is 78.4 m/s, but this speed cannot be reached in survival mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the sky isn't quite high enough for that: Falling from layer 256 to bedrock takes about 5.5 seconds, with impact at 3.5 blocks per tick (70 m/s).</p>
<p>In creative mode, you can fly higher, and could potentially reach terminal velocity falling from &quot;above the sky&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Acceleration</h2>
<p>Acceleration is not talked about on the wiki, however see the change in velocity over time in the following graph. The graph was created using the formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>v(t) = (0.98<sup>t</sup> - 1) × 3.92</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n3FNJ.png" alt="graph showing the change in velocity over time" /></p>
<p>You will notice that acceleration is not constant, and decreases over time.</p>
<h2>How Long?</h2>
<p>Using the velocity time graph, we can find how long it would take to reach terminal velocity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>10% Terminal Velocity (0.392 blocks/tick) :</strong> ≈ 5 ticks (0.4 seconds)</p>
<p><strong>50% Terminal Velocity (1.96 blocks/tick) :</strong> ≈ 35 ticks (1.75 seconds)</p>
<p><strong>75% Terminal Velocity (2.94 blocks/tick) :</strong> ≈ 69 ticks (3.45 seconds)</p>
<p><strong>99% Terminal Velocity (3.8808 blocks/tick) :</strong> ≈ 228 ticks (11.4 seconds)</p>
<p><strong>100% Terminal Velocity (3.92 blocks/tick) :</strong> ≈ 672 ticks (33.6 seconds)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Chicken Science!</h2>
<p>I couldn't find anything on the falling speed of chickens, so I set my own apparatus to test. It involves a 10 block fall with a pressure plate at the bottom, turning on a redstone lamp. I start the timer at the same time that I press the button, and stop the timer when I see the lamp turn on:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8t0Sg.png" alt="My chicken-speed mechanism" /></p>
<p>I timed the fall of 3 different chickens to ensure accurate results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test 1:</strong> 5.0 seconds</p>
<p><strong>Test 2:</strong> 4.9 seconds</p>
<p><strong>Test 3:</strong> 5.1 seconds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This averages out at 5 seconds for a chicken to fall 10 blocks. Using the formula for speed we can calculate the speed of a falling chicken:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>speed = distance / time</code></p>
<p><code>speed = 10 / 5</code></p>
<p><code>speed = 2 m/s</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>∴ The falling speed of a chicken is 2 m/s.</p>
<h2>Higher?</h2>
<p>As per the OP's request, I did the test again at a greater height, 50 blocks to be exact:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e7WKF.png" alt="The top of my extended contraption, now 50 blocks tall" /></p>
<p>I timed the test the same as the others, and received another result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Higher Test 1:</strong> 25.0 seconds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first test I did came back with 25 seconds flat, I didn't feel a need to repeat any more tests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>speed = distance / time</code></p>
<p><code>speed = 50 / 25</code></p>
<p><code>speed = 2 m/s</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: I was using unladen European chickens. I also noticed that chickens reach their maximum velocity as soon as they started falling.</p>
