<p>I want to drop a sheep from <code>n</code> blocks high so that I have a delay before the trap is triggered. The timing needs to be very exact, but I don't know how the falling mechanism works: whether there is acceleration, and how fast it is hit. (I understand this would be different for a chicken.)</p>
<p>Can someone give me some figures of the length of time it takes to reach the terminal velocity, and how many blocks per second a mob will fall at terminal velocity?</p>
<p><strong>50 bonus points</strong> for the answer for chicken speeds as an extra: This will be applied after two days; the best answer in reference to chickens will get the bounty.</p>
