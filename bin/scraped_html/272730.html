Thus it seems most beneficial to evolve your Pokemon with the highest CP, if you have multiple of the same kind. </p>

<p>But what I am not sure about is whether it makes an efficiency difference if you spend candies and dust to boost CP before evolving, to gain more from the amplification? Or is it more efficient to just evolve without spending, and then using the leftover candies afterwards, since they now give a bigger CP boost per candy? </p>

<p>I only tested with a Rattata so far, which gained +8 CP per candy before evolving, and +15 CP afterwards. I collected no numbers on the amplification efficiency though, and now ran out of materials for further testing.</p>

<p>Or maybe it is a balanced calculation and makes no difference at all? I would love to have some insight on that.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some data I collected thus far:
(GPC = CP gain per candy)</p>

<p><strong>79 CP Weedle</strong> (GPC 6) evolved to:<br>
<strong>84 CP Kakuna</strong> (GPC 6), evolved at <strong>90 CP</strong> to:<br>
<strong>297 CP Beedrill</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The max-CP "half circle" in the profile stayed filled roughly at the same relative position throughout the evolutions.</p>

Now under column filters, you should see the database name. Enter the database name for the Like section and you should see traces only for that database.</p>

<p>Assuming you have the Tuning template selected, to filter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click the "Events Selection" tab</li>
<li>Click the "Column Filters" button</li>
<li>Check Show all Columns (Right Side Down)</li>
<li>Select "DatabaseName", click the plus next to Like in the right-hand pane, and type your database name.</li>
</ul>

<p>I always save the trace to a table too so I can do LIKE queries on the trace data after the fact.  </p>

<p>When SQL Profiler 2005 or SQL Profiler 2000 is used with database residing in SQLServer 2000 - problem mentioned problem persists, but when SQL Profiler 2005 is used with SQLServer 2005 database, it works perfect!</p>

<p>In Summary, the issue seems to be prevalent in SQLServer 2000 &amp; rectified in SQLServer 2005.</p>

<p>The solution for the issue when dealing with SQLServer 2000 is (as explained by wearejimbo)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Identify the DatabaseID of the database you want to filter by querying the sysdatabases table as below</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM master..sysdatabases 
WHERE name like '%your_db_name%'   -- Remove this line to see all databases
ORDER BY dbid
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use the DatabaseID Filter (instead of DatabaseName) in the New Trace window of SQL Profiler 2000</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can see the Database Name property and click on it. Expand the like box and insert your DB name and click ok and you can run the profiler now.</p>
