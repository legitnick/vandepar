These two items are high weight, and high value, but I can't seem to find any actual <em>use</em> for them, especially since most of the shopkeepers I talk to aren't interested in purchasing them.</p>

<p>Are these just supposed to be for decorating one's house? Or is there some nefarious purpose for them down the road that I should stockpile them for?</p>
