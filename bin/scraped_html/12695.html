<p>I looked in <code>Program Files/Steam/</code> and I found a folder full of the games I have downloaded, but I do not know if it is safe to just copy these folders from one computer to another (seeing as a lot of other applications will not work if you do this), or is there another recommended way?</p>

<p>I don't really feel like re-downloading all my games. I don't have the time nor bandwidth to download 20GB over a 1.5mbps connection.</p>

<p>Is it possible to contact Valve and get a disk with the games on it?</p>

Any files that do not match are usually re-downloaded from Steam, hence why it will still update a bit after a fresh copy. If you do not want all to redownload just the sounds and maps (which take up the most of the space), you can simply take the .gcf files for each game from <code>Program Files/Steam/SteamApps</code>.</p>

<p>Steam also has a "Backup" feature you can use. The files it creates can be moved from PC to PC and restored on any one.</p>

While the article is written as if you're moving from one directory to another on the same computer, the principles would be alike for moving downloaded content from one computer to another:</p>

<p>I made it many times, and it works also on external HDD, that is easy if you want to show some games to your friends when you don't have your PC with you.</p>

<p>Install Steam, then just copy the directories over onto the new computer, use the same filepaths etc...</p>
<p>And you will need to delete the clientregistry.blob file that you copied over from your old computer. Don't worry Steam will create a new one when you run it on your new computer.</p>

<p>Or re-download the games after installing Steam</p>

<p>You can check the info first.</p>

<p>It was written by a Steam user and was first posted on the Valve developers forum.</p>

<p>It enables easy transfer between separate folders and/or hard drives, and is free, and portable. </p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>There are 2 options to do this. </p>

<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Make a backup of Dota 2 via steam backup and restore function found under "steam" tab.</li>
<li>Copy this back up to new computer.</li>
<li>Install steam, login to your steam account. All games (Including Dota 2) will be visible in your game library. Install Dota 2 via back up you created in step 4. After install is complete, game "MAY" update to download any missing or out dated file.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Copy “common” folder and “appmanifest_570.acf” from PC 1 to a hard disk or USB. This stuff is located in  steamapp folder. Most commonly the address will be C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\</li>
<li>Now go to PC 2 and install steam.</li>
<li>Once steam is installed in PC 2, close it completely and then paste these copied “common” folder and “appmanifest_570.acf” in steamapp folder in PC 2.</li>
<li>Once this procedure is complete, you’ll be able to play Dota 2 on PC 2 as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whatever method you choose, I suggest that you validate game’s cache before starting game. You can do it by going in Dota 2 properties >> Local Files tab >> Verify Integrity of Game Cache.</p>
