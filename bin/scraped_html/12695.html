<p>I looked in <code>Program Files/Steam/</code> and I found a folder full of the games I have downloaded, but I do not know if it is safe to just copy these folders from one computer to another (seeing as a lot of other applications will not work if you do this), or is there another recommended way?</p>

<p>I don't really feel like re-downloading all my games. I don't have the time nor bandwidth to download 20GB over a 1.5mbps connection.</p>

<p>Is it possible to contact Valve and get a disk with the games on it?</p>
