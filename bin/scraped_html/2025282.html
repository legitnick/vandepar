<p><strong>Screen size</strong><br/>
Actual physical size, measured as the screen's diagonal.
For simplicity, Android groups all actual screen sizes into four
generalized sizes: small, normal, large, and extra-large.</p>
<p><strong>Screen density</strong><br/>
The number of pixels within a physical area of the
screen; usually referred to as dpi (dots per inch). For example, a
&quot;low&quot; density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,
compared to a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;high&quot; density screen. For simplicity,
Android groups all actual screen densities into six generalized
densities: low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high, and
extra-extra-extra-high.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation</strong><br/>The orientation of the screen from the user's point of
view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the screen's
aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware that not
only do different devices operate in different orientations by
default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user
rotates the device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong><br/> The total number of physical pixels on
a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do
not work directly with resolution; applications should be concerned
only with screen size and density, as specified by the generalized
size and density groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Density-independent pixel (dp)</strong><br/> A virtual
pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express
layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way.
The density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160
dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a
&quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles
any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density
of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:
<code>px = dp * (dpi / 160)</code>.
For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp
equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when
defining your application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on
screens with different densities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are at all serious about developing an Android app for more than one type of device, you should have read the screens support development document at least once. In addition to that, it is always a good thing to know the actual number of active devices that have a particular screen configuration.</p>

<p>These are dimension values defined in XML. A dimension is specified
with a number followed by a unit of measure. For example: 10px, 2in,
5sp. The following units of measure are supported by Android:</p>
<p><strong>dp</strong></p>
<p>Density-independent Pixels - An abstract unit that is based on the
physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi
(dots per inch) screen, on which 1dp is roughly equal to 1px. When
running on a higher density screen, the number of pixels used to draw
1dp is scaled up by a factor appropriate for the screen's dpi.
Likewise, when on a lower density screen, the number of pixels used
for 1dp is scaled down. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the
screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Using dp
units (instead of px units) is a simple solution to making the view
dimensions in your layout resize properly for different screen
densities. In other words, it provides consistency for the real-world
sizes of your UI elements across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>sp</strong></p>
<p>Scale-independent Pixels - This is like the dp unit, but it is also
scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommended that you use
this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for
both the screen density and the user's preference.</p>
<p><strong>pt</strong></p>
<p>Points - 1/72 of an inch based on the physical size of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>px</strong></p>
<p>Pixels - Corresponds to actual pixels on the screen. This unit of
measure is not recommended because the actual representation can vary
across devices; each device may have a different number of pixels per
inch and may have more or fewer total pixels available on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>mm</strong></p>
<p>Millimeters - Based on the physical size of the screen.</p>

<h3>Density-independent pixel (dp)</h3>
<p>A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or position in a density-independent way. As described above, the density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a &quot;medium&quot; density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is
simple:</p>
<p>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p>
<p>For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure
proper display of your UI on screens with different densities.</p>
<p>Understanding pixel to dp and vice versa is very essential (especially for giving exact dp values to creative team)</p>
<pre><code>dp = px * 160 / dpi

MDPI = 160 dpi || Therefore, on MDPI 1 px = 1 dp
For example, if you want to convert 20 pixel to dp, use the above formula,
dp = 20 * 160 / 160 = 20.
So, 20 pixel = 20 dp.

HDPI = 240 dpi - So, on HDPI 1.5 px = 1 dp
XHDPI = 320 dpi - So, on XHDPI 2 px = 1 dp
XXHDPI = 480 dpi - So, on XXHDPI 3 px = 1 dp

For example, let us consider Nexus 4.
If 24 pixels to be converted to dp and if it is a Nexus 4 screen, developers can
convert it to dp easily by the following calculation :
dp = 24 * 160 / 320 = 12 dp
Screen dimension:
768 x 1280 pixel resolution (320 ppi or 320dpi)
Optional (screen size):
 4.7&quot; diagonal
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Try to get all pixel values in even numbers from the creative team. Otherwise precision lose will happen while multiplying with 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<h3>px</h3>
<p>It is explained above. Try to avoid in layout files. But there are some cases, where px is required. for example, ListView divider line. px is better here for giving a one-pixel line as a divider for all across screen resolutions.</p>
<h3>sp</h3>
<p>Use sp for font sizes. Then only the font inside the application will change while device fonts size changes (that is, Display -&gt; Fonts on Device). If you want to keep a static sized font inside the app, you can give the font dimension in dp. In such a case, it will never change. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp. In all other cases, sp is recommended.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk about using "sp" for font sizes, and while I appreciate the point, I don't think that it is the right thing to do from a design point of view. You can end up breaking your design if the user has some wonky font size selection, and the user will end up blaming <em>the app</em>, and not their own life choices.</p>

<p>Also, if you take an sp-font app on a 160&nbsp;dpi tablet, you will find that <em>everything</em> scales up... but your font, which is going to look tiny in comparison. It isn't a good look.</p>

<p>While the idea of "sp" fonts has a good heart, it is a poor idea. Stick with dp for everything.</p>

<p>So 240 dpi device's 1 dp will have = 1 * (240/160) = 3/2 = 1.5 pixels.</p>
<p>And 480 dpi device's 1 dp will have = 1 * (480/160) = 3 pixels.</p>
<p>Using this 1.5 and 3 pixels knowledge, a software engineer can design layouts for different densities.</p>

Below mentioned is some information to be considered in addition to the above answers. Most Android developers miss this while developing apps, so I am adding these points.</p>
<p>sp = scale independent pixel</p>
<p>dp = density independent pixels</p>
<p>dpi = density pixels</p>
<p>I have gone through the above answers...not finding them exactly correct.
sp for text size, dp for layout bounds - standard.
But <strong>sp for text size will break the layout if used carelessly</strong> in most of the devices.</p>
<p>sp take the text size of the device, whereas dp take that of device density standard( never change in a device)
Say 100sp text can occupy 80% of the screen or 100% of the screen depending on the font size set in the device</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9syOs.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9syOs.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>You can use sp for layout bounds also, it will work :)
<strong>No standard app use sp for whole text</strong></p>
<p>Use sp and dp for text size considering UX.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use sp for text in the toolbar( can use android dimens available for different screen sizes with dp)</li>
<li>Don't use sp for text in small bounded buttons, very smaller text, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people use huge FONT size in their phone for more readability, giving them small hardcoded sized text will be a UX issue. Put sp for text where necessary, but make sure it won't break the layout when the user changes his settings.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have a single app supporting all dimensions, adding xxxhdpi assets increases the app size a lot. But now xxxhdpi phones are common so we have to include xxxhdpi assets at least for icons in the sidebar, toolbar, and bottom bar. It's better to move to vector images to have a uniform and better quality images for all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Also, note that people use custom fonts on their phones. So lack of a font can cause problems regarding spacing and all. Say text size 12sp for a custom font may take some pixels extra than the default font.</p>

Yes, I know that it's somehow described in Google docs (and mentioned in the posts above), I read that but it was not good for me (yeah, I may be too stupid)). It remained unclear to me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen sizes.

<p>Android has not bad UI concept, but lacks iOS Storyboard features, unfortunately. Designing flexible UI in Android is not an easy thing (at the best).</p>

<p><strong>How to Design UI for Android Apps for Different Screen Size</strong></p>
<p>To design an app UI for different screen sizes, our initial design has to
meet a minimum required space for each screen size. Android defines a
minimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an
Android screen size guideline.
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPEMR.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPEMR.jpg" alt="Minimum Screen Size for Android in dp" /></a>
When we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design
the Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics
and bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density
guideline.
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Px14F.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Px14F.jpg" alt="Android Density Guideline (dpi)" /></a></p>
<p>For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between
the four generalized densities. If we create a 36×36 pixel picture for
ldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48×48 for mdpi,
72×72 for hdpi, and 96×96 for xhdpi.</p>
<p><strong>How to Design Android Apps UI in Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Many designers have problems designing Android app UI in photoshop or another pixel
based graphic design tools because of the density-independent unit, dp.
Designers don’t know how to map dp to pixel. Google also doesn’t give
a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic
formula for dp and pixel translation.</p>
<p>As Android’s definition, 1pd equal to 1px under 160 dpi device (mdpi).
So we want to design an Android app for xlarge Android devices with
mdpi density, we can define our UI size in pixel as 960 pixels in width
and 720px in height; Follow the same mapping rule, we can get
following Android App screen size UI design guideline:</p>

<p>The number of pixels represented in one unit of dp will increase as the screen resolution increases (when you have more dots/pixels per inch). Conversely on devices with lower resolution, the number of pixels represented in on unit of dp will decrease. Since this is a relative unit, it needs to have a baseline to be compared with. This baseline is a 160 dpi screen. This is the equation: <code>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</code></p>

<p><br>
2) <strong><code>sp: (scale independent pixels)</code></strong></p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 24 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The screen of a mobile phone is made up of thousands of tiny dots known as <strong>pixels (px)</strong>. A pixel is the smallest element which goes to make the picture. The more the number of pixels to make a picture or wording, the sharper it becomes and makes the smartphone screen more easily readable.</p>

<p>Screen resolution is measured in terms of number of pixels on the screen. Screen resolution is a commonly-used specification when buying a device, but it's actually not that useful when designing for Android because thinking of screens in terms of pixels ignores the notion of physical size, which for a touch device is really really important.</p>

<p><strong>Density independent pixel (dp or dip)</strong> allow the designer to create assets that appear in a expected way, no matter the resolution or density of target device.</p>

<p>A density independent pixel (dp or dip) is equal to one pixel at the baseline density or 160 dpi (dots per inch).</p>

<p>1 px/1dp = 160 dpi/160 dpi</p>

<p>2 px/1dp = 320 dpi(2x)/160 dpi</p>

<p>where,</p>

<p>dpi is dots per inch</p>

<p>So, at 320 dpi, 1 dp is equal to 2 px.</p>

<p>Formula</p>

<p>px/dp = dpi/160dpi</p>

<p>Dots per inch (dpi) is a measure of the sharpness (that is, the density of illuminated points) on a display screen. The dots per inch for a given picture resolution will differ based on the overall screen size since the same number of pixels are being spread out over a different space.</p>

<p>Working with density independent pixels help us to deal with a situation like where you have two devices with same pixel resolution, but differing amount of space. Suppose in a case, a tablet and phone has the same pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels (160 dpi) and 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi) respectively.</p>

<p>Now because a tablet is at baseline density (160 dpi) its physical and density independent pixels sizes are the same, 1280 by 800. The phone on the other hand has a higher pixel density, so it has half as many density independent pixels as physical pixels. So a phone has 400 by 640 density independent pixels. So using a density-independent pixel makes it easier to mentally picture that tablet has much more space than the phone.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have two devices with similar screen size, but different pixel density, say one is 800 by 1280 pixels (320 dpi), and the other is 400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi), we don't need to define totally different layouts for these two devices as we can measure assets in terms of density independent pixel which is same for both devices.</p>

<p>800 by 1280 pixels (320dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p>400 by 640 pixels (160 dpi)=400 by 640 density independent pixel (dp)</p>

<p><strong>Scale independent pixels(sp)</strong> is the preferred unit for font size.
For accessibility purposes, Android allows users to customize their device's font size. Users that have trouble reading text can increase their device's font size. You can normally find this option in the display setting on your phone or tablet under font size. It's often also available through the accessibility settings.</p>

<p>With scale independent pixels, 16 sp is exactly the same as 16 dp when the device's font size is normal or 100%. But when device's font size is large, for example 125%, 16 sp will translate to 20 dp or 1.25 times 16.</p>

<p>If you use dp as the unit for font size, then that piece of text has a specific physical size no matter if the user has customize device's font size. Using sp units will make a better experience for people with impaired eyesight.</p>

<p><strong>Density-independent Pixels (dp or dip)</strong> – an abstract unit that is based on the physical density of the screen. These units are relative to a 160 dpi screen, so one dp is one pixel on a 160 dpi screen. The ratio of dp-to-pixel will change with the screen density, but not necessarily in direct proportion. Note: The compiler accepts both “dip” and “dp”, though “dp” is more consistent with “sp”.</p>
<p><strong>Scale-independent Pixels(sp)</strong> – this is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user’s font size preference. It is recommended you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and user’s preference.</p>

<p>The only problem is that, the android dpi of some screens are not accurate. For example, a screen classified to 160dpi may have 170dpi indeed. So the computation result of <code>dp</code> is fuzzy. It should be approximately the same as <code>1/160 inch</code>.</p>

<p>Try the <a href="https://github.com/intuit/sdp" rel="noreferrer">sdp</a> library from Intuit. It's very handy to solve unit problems, and you can <em>quickly support multiple screens</em>.</p>

<p>Usage</p>

<p><code>android:paddingBottom="@dimen/_15sdp"</code> for positive and <code>android:layout_marginTop="@dimen/_minus10sdp"</code>  for negative sdp sdp</p>

<p>It has equivalent value in dp for each size in <code>values-sw&lt;N&gt;dp</code> folders (sw = smallestWidth).</p>

<p><strong>Attention</strong></p>

<p>Use it carefully! In most cases you still need to design a different layout for tablets.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LinearLayout
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:layout_marginTop="@dimen/_minus10sdp"
          android:paddingBottom="@dimen/_15sdp"
          android:orientation="horizontal" &gt;

                &lt;TextView
                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                    android:includeFontPadding="false"
                    android:text="♡"
                    android:textColor="#ED6C27"
                    android:textSize="@dimen/_70sdp"
                    android:textStyle="bold" /&gt;

                &lt;TextView
                    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                    android:includeFontPadding="false"
                    android:text="U"
                    android:textColor="@android:color/black"
                    android:textSize="@dimen/_70sdp" /&gt;
            &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;

<p>You can use db for text size, but I prefer <a href="https://github.com/intuit/ssp" rel="noreferrer">ssp</a> for text size.</p>

<p>For more details, check <a href="https://github.com/intuit/sdp" rel="noreferrer">the library GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The compiler accepts both "<strong>dip</strong>" and "<strong>dp</strong>", though "<strong>dp</strong>" is more consistent with "<strong>sp</strong>".</p>

<p><strong>Scale-independent Pixels</strong> - this is like the <strong>dp</strong> unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference.</p>
