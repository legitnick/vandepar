Not wanting to let a perfectly good dead body go to waste I decided to loot it, including his clothing. Apparently the courier re-spawned and now is not wearing any clothing when he delivers.</p>

<p>It is a little awkward when I am walking through a city and a naked man walks up to you and says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have special package for you, your eyes only!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any console command to re-spawn him to make him come back with his normal clothing?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Proof that it happened.</p>

<p>Also another note, reverse pickpocketing clothing did not fix it. In fact he had clothing in his inventory already that he chose not to equip.</p>
