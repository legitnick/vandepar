Not wanting to let a perfectly good dead body go to waste I decided to loot it, including his clothing. Apparently the courier re-spawned and now is not wearing any clothing when he delivers.</p>

<p>It is a little awkward when I am walking through a city and a naked man walks up to you and says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have special package for you, your eyes only!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any console command to re-spawn him to make him come back with his normal clothing?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: Proof that it happened.</p>

<p>Also another note, reverse pickpocketing clothing did not fix it. In fact he had clothing in his inventory already that he chose not to equip.</p>

<p>Open the console and click on the fellow with the mouse.</p>

<pre><code>ShowInventory
</code></pre>

<p>Find the items you want him to wear and look for the FormID.</p>

<pre><code>1 - Item Name (FormID) (other stuff)
</code></pre>

<p>Then enter:</p>

<pre><code>EquipItem FormID
</code></pre>

<p>Where FormID is the number you got from the inventory print out.</p>

<p><sub>As for why it took Bethesda more than a year to fix this, I have no idea.</sub></p>

<p>If that doesn't work, you could also <code>disable</code> and then <code>enable</code> him to see whether that will reset him.</p>
