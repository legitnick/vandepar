<p>It may be my inner OCD, but situations like this annoy me to no end. Sometimes, a patch of water is "ruined" for no apparent rational reason and all attempts to restore it to normality are met with failure.</p>

<p>My latest attempt was building dirt where the currents were, then removing it. The result is pictured. :/</p>

<p>Is there something I can do about it, or is it just a glitch?</p>
