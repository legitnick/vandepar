<hr />
<p>First, update all <code>origin/&lt;branch&gt;</code> refs to latest:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git fetch --all
</code></pre>
<p>Backup your current branch (e.g. <code>master</code>):</p>
<pre><code>git branch backup-master
</code></pre>
<p>Jump to the latest commit on <code>origin/master</code> and checkout those files:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard origin/master
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p><code>git fetch</code> downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.</p>
<p><code>git reset</code> resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The <code>--hard</code> option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in <code>origin/master</code>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Maintain current local commits</h3>
<p><sup>[*]</sup>: It's worth noting that it is possible to maintain current local commits by creating a branch from <code>master</code> before resetting:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git checkout master
git branch new-branch-to-save-current-commits
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
</code></pre>
<p>After this, all of the old commits will be kept in <code>new-branch-to-save-current-commits</code>.</p>
<h3>Uncommitted changes</h3>
<p>Uncommitted changes, however (even staged), will be lost. Make sure to stash and commit anything you need. For that you can run the following:</p>
<pre><code>git stash
</code></pre>
<p>And then to reapply these uncommitted changes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash pop
</code></pre>

But though Hedgehog's answer might be better, I don't think it is as elegant as it could be.  The way I found to do this is by using <code>fetch</code> and <code>merge</code> with a defined strategy. Which should make it so that your local changes are preserved as long as they are not one of the files that you are trying to force an overwrite with.</p>
<h3>First do a commit of your changes</h3>
<pre><code> git add *
 git commit -a -m &quot;local file server commit message&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Then fetch the changes and overwrite if there is a conflict</h3>
<pre><code> git fetch origin master
 git merge -s recursive -X theirs origin/master
</code></pre>
<p><code>-X</code> is an option name, and <code>theirs</code> is the value for that option. You're choosing to use <code>their</code> changes (the other option is <code>ours</code> changes) if there is a conflict.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 68 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The problem with all these solutions is that they are all either too complex or, an even bigger problem, is that they remove all untracked files from the webserver, which we don't want since there are always needed configuration files which are on the server and not in the Git repository.</p>
<p>Here is the cleanest solution which we are using:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code># Fetch the newest code
git fetch

# Delete all files which are being added, so there
# are no conflicts with untracked files
for file in `git diff HEAD..origin/master --name-status | awk '/^A/ {print $2}'`

do
    git checkout -- &quot;$file&quot;
done

# Finally pull all the changes
# (you could merge as well e.g. 'merge origin/master')
git pull
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>The first command fetches the newest data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second command checks if there are any files that are being added to the repository and deletes those untracked files from the local repository which would cause conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The third command checks-out all the files which were locally modified.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, we do a pull to update to the newest version, but this time without any conflicts, since untracked files which are in the repo don't exist anymore and all the locally modified files are already the same as in the repository.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 64 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>First of all, try the standard way:</p>

<pre><code>git reset HEAD --hard # To remove all not committed changes!
git clean -fd         # To remove all untracked (non-git) files and folders!
</code></pre>

<p><sup><strong>Warning</strong>: Above commands can results in data/files loss only if you don't have them committed! If you're not sure, make the backup first of your whole repository folder.</sup></p>

<p>Then pull it again.</p>

<p>If above won't help and you don't care about your untracked files/directories (make the backup first just in case), try the following simple steps:</p>

<pre><code>cd your_git_repo  # where 'your_git_repo' is your git repository folder
rm -rfv *         # WARNING: only run inside your git repository!
git pull          # pull the sources again
</code></pre>

<p>This will REMOVE all git files (excempt <code>.git/</code> dir, where you have all commits) and pull it again.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why <code>git reset HEAD --hard</code> could fail in some cases?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Custom rules in <code>.gitattributes file</code></p>

<p>Having <code>eol=lf</code> rule in .gitattributes could cause git to modify some file changes by converting CRLF line-endings into LF in some text files.</p>

<p>If that's the case, you've to commit these CRLF/LF changes (by reviewing them in <code>git status</code>), or try: <code>git config core.autcrlf false</code> to temporary ignore them.</p></li>
<li><p>File system incompability</p>

<p>When you're using file-system which doesn't support permission attributes.
In example you have two repositories, one on Linux/Mac (<code>ext3</code>/<code>hfs+</code>) and another one on FAT32/NTFS based file-system.</p>

<p>As you notice, there are two different kind of file systems, so the one which doesn't support Unix permissions basically can't reset file permissions on system which doesn't support that kind of permissions, so no matter how <code>--hard</code> you try, git always detect some "changes".</p></li>

As others have pointed out, simply doing hard reset will remove <strong>all</strong> the untracked files which could include lots of things that you don't want removed, such as config files.  What is safer, is to remove only the files that are about to be added, and for that matter, you'd likely also want to checkout any locally-modified files that are about to be updated.</p>

<p>That in mind, I updated Kustudic's script to do just that.  I also fixed a typo (a missing ' in the original).</p>

<pre><code>git pull
git reset origin/master
git checkout &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...
</code></pre>

<p>You can of course use <code>git fetch</code> instead of <code>git pull</code> since it clearly isn't going to merge, but if you usually pull it makes sense to continue to pull here.</p>

<p>So what happens here is that <code>git pull</code> <strong>updates your origin/master reference</strong>; <code>git reset</code> <strong>updates your local branch reference</strong> on to be the same as origin/master without updating any files, so your checked-out state is unchanged; then <code>git checkout</code> <strong>reverts files to your local branch index state</strong> as needed. In cases where exactly the same file has been added on live and on upstream master, the index already matches the file following the reset, so in the common case you don't need to do <code>git checkout</code> at all.</p>

<p>If the upstream branch also contains commits which you want to apply automatically, you can follow a subtle variation on the process:</p>

<pre><code>git pull
git merge &lt;commit before problem commit&gt;
git reset &lt;problem commit&gt;
git checkout &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...

<p>The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog" rel="noreferrer">reflog</a> <em>records branches and other references being updated in the local repository</em>. Or simply put - the <strong>reflog</strong> is the <strong>history of your changes</strong>.</p>

<li><code>git merge</code> lists among other things all those files. They are prepended by some white-space.</li>
<li><code>2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null</code> redirects the error output to the standard one so it is picked up by <code>grep</code>.</li>
<li><code>grep ^[[:space:]]</code> filters only the lines with file names.</li>
<li><code>sed s/^[[:space:]]//g</code> trims the white-space from the beginning.</li>
<li><code>xargs -L1 rm</code> calls <code>rm</code> on each of those files, deleting them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Handle with care: Whatever <code>git merge</code> outputs, the <code>rm</code> will be called for <strong>every</strong> line beginning with a white-space.</p>

<pre><code>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-starter.git

cd angular2-webpack-starter/

git checkout -b material2

<p>Open the project folder and delete all non-hidden files and folders. Leave all the hidden ones.</p>
