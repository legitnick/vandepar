<p>So, naturally, I'm trying to kill them.</p>

<p>Not because I expect it to be useful, just because the idea amuses me.  Of course, the problem with this plan is that my arsenal is having distressingly little effect on them.  Lasers, poisonous thorns, hell-forged steel… it all passes harmlessly through them.  And I haven't been able to nail one of the little bast— er, <em>dearies</em> with a grenade, yet, so I don't even know whether <em>that's</em> effective.</p>

<p>So, any thoughts on how to kill them?</p>
