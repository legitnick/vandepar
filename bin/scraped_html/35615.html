<p>We recently discovered that the Google Maps API does not play nicely with SSL.  Fair enough, but what are some options for overcoming this that others have used effectively?</p>

  <p>At this time, the Maps API is not
  available over a secure (SSL)
  connection. If you are running the
  Maps API on a secure site, the browser
  may warn the user about non-secure
  objects on the screen.</p>

<p>We have considered the following options</p>

<ol>
<li>Splitting the page so that credit card collection (the requirement for SSL) is not on the same page as the Google Map.</li>
<li>Switching to another map provider, such as Virtual Earth.  Rumor has it that they support SSL.</li>
<li>Playing tricks with IFRAMEs.  Sounds kludgy.</li>
<li>Proxying the calls to Google.  Sounds like a lot of overhead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are there other options, or does anyone have insight into the options that we have considered?</p>

<p>I'd agree with the previous two answers that in this instance it may be better from a usability perspective to split the two functions into separate screens. You really want your users to be focussed on entering complete and accurate credit card information, and having a map on the same screen may be distracting.</p>

<p>For the record though, Virtual Earth certainly does fully support SSL. To enable it you simple need to change the script reference from http:// to https:// and append &amp;s=1 to the URL, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="http://dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6.1" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>becomes</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6.1&amp;s=1" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
