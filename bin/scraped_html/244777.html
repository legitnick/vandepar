<p>JSON is data-only. If you include a comment, then it must be data too.</p>
<p>You could have a designated data element called <code>&quot;_comment&quot;</code> (or something) that should be ignored by apps that use the JSON data.</p>
<p>You would probably be better having the comment in the processes that generates/receives the JSON, as they are supposed to know what the JSON data will be in advance, or at least the structure of it.</p>
<p>But if you decided to:</p>
<pre><code>{
   &quot;_comment&quot;: &quot;comment text goes here...&quot;,
   &quot;glossary&quot;: {
      &quot;title&quot;: &quot;example glossary&quot;,

<p>As has been pointed out, this hack takes advantage of the implementation of the spec. Not all JSON parsers will understand this sort of JSON. Streaming parsers in particular will choke.</p>

<p>It's an interesting curiosity, but you <strong>should really not be using it for anything at all</strong>. Below is the original answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've found a little hack that allows you to place comments in a JSON file that will not affect the parsing, or alter the data being represented in any way.</p>

<p>It appears that when declaring an object literal you can specify two values with the same key, and the last one takes precedence. Believe it or not, it turns out that JSON parsers work the same way. So we can use this to create comments in the source JSON that will not be present in a parsed object representation. </p>

<pre><code>({a: 1, a: 2});
// =&gt; Object {a: 2}
Object.keys(JSON.parse('{"a": 1, "a": 2}')).length; 
// =&gt; 1
</code></pre>

<p>If we apply this technique, your commented JSON file might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "api_host" : "The hostname of your API server. You may also specify the port.",
  "api_host" : "hodorhodor.com",

  "retry_interval" : "The interval in seconds between retrying failed API calls",
  "retry_interval" : 10,

  "auth_token" : "The authentication token. It is available in your developer dashboard under 'Settings'",
  "auth_token" : "5ad0eb93697215bc0d48a7b69aa6fb8b",

  "favorite_numbers": "An array containing my all-time favorite numbers",
  "favorite_numbers": [19, 13, 53]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above code is <a href="http://jsonlint.com/" rel="noreferrer">valid JSON</a>. If you parse it, you'll get an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "api_host": "hodorhodor.com",
    "retry_interval": 10,
    "auth_token": "5ad0eb93697215bc0d48a7b69aa6fb8b",
    "favorite_numbers": [19,13,53]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which means there is no trace of the comments, and they won't have weird side-effects.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<p>The official JSON site is at <a href="http://json.org" rel="noreferrer">JSON.org</a>. JSON is defined as a <a href="http://ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-404.htm" rel="noreferrer">standard</a> by ECMA International. There is always a petition process to have standards revised. It is unlikely that annotations will be added to the JSON standard for several reasons.</p>
<p>JSON by design is an easily reverse-engineered (human parsed) alternative to XML. It is simplified even to the point that annotations are unnecessary. It is not even a markup language. The goal is stability and  interoperablilty.</p>
<p>Anyone who understands the &quot;has-a&quot; relationship of object orientation can understand any JSON structure - that is the whole point. It is just a  directed acyclic graph (DAG) with node tags (key/value pairs), which is a near universal data structure.</p>
<p>This only annotation required might be &quot;//These are DAG tags&quot;. The key names can be as informative as required, allowing arbitrary semantic arity.</p>
<p>Any platform can parse JSON with just a few lines of code. XML requires complex OO libraries that are not viable on many platforms.</p>
<p>Annotations would just make JSON less interoperable. There is simply nothing else to add unless what you really need is a markup language (XML), and don't care if your persisted data is easily parsed.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> as the creator of JSON also observed, there has always been JS pipeline support for comments:</p>

<p>If people have strong reasons against having comments in JSON when communicating data (whether valid or not), then possibly JSON could be split into two:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON-COM: JSON on the wire, or rules that apply when communicating JSON data.</li>
<li>JSON-DOC: JSON document, or JSON in files or locally. Rules that define a valid JSON document.</li>

<p>We're talking about a generic config file issue (cross language/platform), and he's answering with a JS specific utility!</p>
<p>Sure a JSON specific minify can be implemented in any language,
but standardize this so it becomes ubiquitous across parsers in all languages and platforms so people stop wasting their time lacking the feature because they have good use-cases for it, looking the issue up in online forums, and getting people telling them it's a bad idea or suggesting it's easy to implement stripping comments out of text files.</p>
<p>The other issue is interoperability. Suppose you have a library or API or any kind of subsystem which has some config or data files associated with it. And this subsystem is
to be accessed from different languages.  Then do you go about telling people: by the way
don't forget to strip out the comments from the JSON files before passing them to the parser!</p>

<p>The JSON5 Data Interchange Format (JSON5) is a superset of JSON that aims to alleviate some of the limitations of JSON. It is fully backwards compatible, and using it is probably better than writing the custom non standard parser, turning non standard features on for the existing one or using various hacks like string fields for commenting. Or, if the parser in use supports, simply agree <em>we are using JSON 5 subset that is JSON and C++ style comments</em>. It is much better than <em>we tweak JSON standard the way we see fit</em>.</p>

<p>As many people have suggested, there are some tricks, for example, duplicate keys or a specific key <code>_comment</code> that you can use. It's up to you.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 26 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><em><strong>Disclaimer: This is silly</strong></em></p>
<p>There is actually a way to add comments, and stay within the specification (no additional parser needed). It will not result into human-readable comments without any sort of parsing though.</p>
<p>You could abuse the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insignificant whitespace is allowed before or after any token.
Whitespace is any sequence of one or more of the following code
points: character tabulation (U+0009), line feed (U+000A), carriage
return (U+000D), and space (U+0020).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a hacky way, you can abuse this to add a comment. For instance: start and end your comment with a tab. Encode the comment in base3 and use the other whitespace characters to represent them. For instance.</p>
<pre><code>010212 010202 011000 011000 011010 001012 010122 010121 011021 010202 001012 011022 010212 011020 010202 010202
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>hello base three</code> in ASCII) But instead of 0 use space, for 1 use line feed and for 2 use carriage return.</p>
<p>This will just leave you with a lot of unreadable whitespace (unless you make an IDE plugin to encode/decode it on the fly).</p>
<p>I never even tried this, for obvious reasons and neither should you.</p>

<p>No, you shouldn't use duplicative object members to stuff side channel data into a JSON encoding. (See &quot;The names within an object SHOULD be unique&quot; <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the RFC</a>).</p>

<p>But if you want a way of inserting and extracting arbitrary side-channel data to a valid JSON, here is an answer. We take advantage of the non-unique representation of data in a JSON encoding. This is allowed<sup>*</sup> in section two of the RFC under &quot;whitespace is allowed before or after any of the six structural characters&quot;.</p>
<p><i><sup>*</sup>The RFC only states &quot;whitespace is allowed before or after any of the six structural characters&quot;, not explicitly mentioning strings, numbers, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, and &quot;null&quot;. This omission is ignored in ALL implementations.</i></p>
<hr />
<p>First, canonicalize your JSON by minifying it:</p>
<pre><code>$jsonMin = json_encode(json_decode($json));
</code></pre>
<p>Then encode your comment in binary:</p>
<pre><code>$hex = unpack('H*', $comment);
$commentBinary = base_convert($hex[1], 16, 2);
</code></pre>
<p>Then steg your binary:</p>
<pre><code>$steg = str_replace('0', ' ', $commentBinary);
$steg = str_replace('1', &quot;\t&quot;, $steg);
</code></pre>
<p>Here is your output:</p>
<pre><code>$jsonWithComment = $steg . $jsonMin;
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 25 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>JSON doesn't allow comments, per se.

If JSON should have comments, why not standardize them, and let the JSON parser do the job? I don't agree with the logic there, but, alas, that's the standard. Using a YAML solution as suggested by others is good, but it requires a library dependency.</p>

<p>If you want to strip out comments, but don't want to have a library dependency, here is a two-line solution, which works for C++-style comments, but can be adapted to others:</p>

<pre><code>var comments = new RegExp("//.*", 'mg');
data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(sample_file, 'utf8').replace(comments, ''));
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this solution can only be used in cases where you can be sure that the JSON data does not contain the comment initiator, e.g. ('//').</p>

<p>Another way to achieve JSON parsing, stripping of comments, and no extra library, is to evaluate the JSON in a JavaScript interpreter. The caveat with that approach, of course, is that you would only want to evaluate untainted data (no untrusted user-input). Here is an example of this approach in Node.js -- another caveat, the following example will only read the data once and then it will be cached:</p>

<p>eg:-</p>
<pre><code>     {
        &quot;comment&quot; : &quot;This is a comment&quot;,
        &quot;//&quot; :  &quot;This also comment&quot;,
        &quot;name&quot; : &quot;This is a real value&quot;
     }
</code></pre>

<pre><code>module.exports = {
    "key": "value",

    // And with comments!
    "key2": "value2"
};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>require</code> syntax will still be the same. Being JavaScript, the file extension should be <code>.js</code>.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>As many answers have already pointed out, JSON does not natively have comments. Of course sometimes you want them anyway. For <strong>Python</strong>, two ways to do that are with <a href="https://github.com/vaidik/commentjson" rel="noreferrer"><code>commentjson</code></a> (<code>#</code> and <code>//</code> for Python&nbsp;2 only) or <a href="https://github.com/mverleg/pyjson_tricks" rel="noreferrer"><code>json_tricks</code></a> (<code>#</code> or <code>//</code> for Python&nbsp;2 and Python&nbsp;3), which has several other features. Disclaimer: I made <code>json_tricks</code>.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You can use simple preprocessing via regular expressions. For instance, the following function will decode commented JSON in PHP:</p>

<pre><code>function json_decode_commented ($data, $objectsAsArrays = false, $maxDepth = 512, $opts = 0) {
  $data = preg_replace('~
    (" (?:[^"\\\\] | \\\\\\\\ | \\\\")*+ ") | \# [^\v]*+ | // [^\v]*+ | /\* .*? \*/
  ~xs', '$1', $data);

  return json_decode($data, $objectsAsArrays, $maxDepth, $opts);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It supports all PHP-style comments: /*, #, //. String literals are preserved as is.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Although JSON does not support comments, <strong>JSONC</strong> does.</p>
<p>Name your file with '.jsonc' extension and use a <strong>jsonc</strong> parser.<br />
Sorry if this answer was too late.</p>
<pre><code>jsonWithComments.jsonc
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-json prettyprint-override"><code>{
    // This is a comment!
    &quot;something&quot;: &quot;idk&quot;

}
