<p>It's boilerplate code that protects users from accidentally invoking the script when they didn't intend to. Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. <code>import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard</code>), then the latter script will trigger the former to run <em>at import time</em> and <em>using the second script's command line arguments</em>. This is almost always a mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Long Answer</h1>
<p>To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.</p>
<p>Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it sets a few special variables like <code>__name__</code>, and then</p>
</li>
<li><p>it executes all of the code found in the file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the <code>__name__</code> checks we always see in Python scripts.</p>
<h2>Code Sample</h2>
<p>Let's use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work.  Suppose the following is in a file called <code>foo.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code># Suppose this is foo.py.

print(&quot;before import&quot;)
import math

print(&quot;before function_a&quot;)
def function_a():
    print(&quot;Function A&quot;)

print(&quot;before function_b&quot;)
def function_b():
    print(&quot;Function B {}&quot;.format(math.sqrt(100)))

print(&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    function_a()
    function_b()
print(&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Special Variables</h2>
<p>When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the <code>__name__</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>When Your Module Is the Main Program</strong></p>
<p>If you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>python foo.py
</code></pre>
<p>the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> to the <code>__name__</code> variable, i.e.</p>
<pre><code># It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when run as the main program.
__name__ = &quot;__main__&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>When Your Module Is Imported By Another</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:</p>
<pre><code># Suppose this is in some other main program.
import foo
</code></pre>
<p>The interpreter will search for your <code>foo.py</code> file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> from the import statement to the <code>__name__</code> variable, i.e.</p>
<pre><code># It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when it's imported from another module.
__name__ = &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Executing the Module's Code</h2>
<p>After the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before import&quot;</code> (without quotes).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It loads the <code>math</code> module and assigns it to a variable called <code>math</code>. This is equivalent to replacing <code>import math</code> with the following (note that <code>__import__</code> is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># Find and load a module given its string name, &quot;math&quot;,
# then assign it to a local variable called math.
math = __import__(&quot;math&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before function_a&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It executes the <code>def</code> block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called <code>function_a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before function_b&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It executes the second <code>def</code> block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called <code>function_b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only When Your Module Is the Main Program</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>If your module is the main program, then it will see that <code>__name__</code> was indeed set to <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> and it calls the two functions, printing the strings <code>&quot;Function A&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Function B 10.0&quot;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>(<strong>instead</strong>) If your module is not the main program but was imported by another one, then <code>__name__</code> will be <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>, not <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>, and it'll skip the body of the <code>if</code> statement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>It will print the string <code>&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;</code> in both situations.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em></p>
<p>In summary, here's what'd be printed in the two cases:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code># What gets printed if foo is the main program
before import
before function_a
before function_b
before __name__ guard
Function A
Function B 10.0
after __name__ guard
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code># What gets printed if foo is imported as a regular module
before import
before function_a
before function_b
before __name__ guard
after __name__ guard
</code></pre>
<h2>Why Does It Work This Way?</h2>
<p>You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this.  Well, sometimes you want to write a <code>.py</code> file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing <code>.py</code> files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. &quot;Running&quot; the script is a side effect of importing the script's module.</p>
<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Question: Can I have multiple <code>__name__</code> checking blocks?  Answer: it's strange to do so, but the language won't stop you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suppose the following is in <code>foo2.py</code>.  What happens if you say <code>python foo2.py</code> on the command-line? Why?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is foo2.py.

    print(&quot;a2&quot;)
    function_b()

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now, figure out what will happen if you remove the <code>__name__</code> check in <code>foo3.py</code>:</li>

</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is in foo4.py

<pre><code>python myscript.py
</code></pre>

<p>all of the code that is at indentation level 0 gets executed.  Functions and classes that are defined are, well, defined, but none of their code gets run.  Unlike other languages, there's no <code>main()</code> function that gets run automatically - the <code>main()</code> function is implicitly all the code at the top level.</p>

<p>In this case, the top-level code is an <code>if</code> block.  <code>__name__</code> is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.  However, if a module is being run directly (as in <code>myscript.py</code> above), then <code>__name__</code> instead is set to the string <code>"__main__"</code>.  Thus, you can test whether your script is being run directly or being imported by something else by testing</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>If your script is being imported into another module, its various function and class definitions will be imported and its top-level code will be executed, but the code in the then-body of the <code>if</code> clause above won't get run as the condition is not met. As a basic example, consider the following two scripts:</p>

<pre><code># file one.py
def func():
    print("func() in one.py")

print("top-level in one.py")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("one.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("one.py is being imported into another module")
</code></pre>



<pre><code># file two.py
import one

print("top-level in two.py")
one.func()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("two.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("two.py is being imported into another module")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you invoke the interpreter as</p>

<pre><code>python one.py
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be</p>

<pre><code>top-level in one.py
one.py is being run directly
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>two.py</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>python two.py

<p>You get</p>

<pre><code>top-level in one.py
one.py is being imported into another module
top-level in two.py
func() in one.py
two.py is being run directly
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, when module <code>one</code> gets loaded, its <code>__name__</code> equals <code>"one"</code> instead of <code>"__main__"</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Why do we need this?</p>

<h2>Developing and Testing Your Code</h2>

<p>Say you're writing a Python script designed to be used as a module:</p>

<pre><code>def do_important():
    """This function does something very important"""
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>could</em> test the module by adding this call of the function to the bottom:</p>

<pre><code>do_important()
</code></pre>

<p>and running it (on a command prompt) with something like:</p>

<pre><code>~$ python important.py
</code></pre>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>However, if you want to import the module to another script:</p>

<pre><code>import important
</code></pre>

<p>On import, the <code>do_important</code> function would be called, so you'd probably comment out your function call, <code>do_important()</code>, at the bottom. </p>

<pre><code># do_important() # I must remember to uncomment to execute this!
</code></pre>

<p>And then you'll have to remember whether or not you've commented out your test function call. And this extra complexity would mean you're likely to forget, making your development process more troublesome.</p>

<h2>A Better Way</h2>

<p>The <code>__name__</code> variable points to the namespace wherever the Python interpreter happens to be at the moment. </p>

<p>Inside an imported module, it's the name of that module. </p>

<p>But inside the primary module (or an interactive Python session, i.e. the interpreter's Read, Eval, Print Loop, or REPL) you are running everything from its <code>"__main__"</code>.</p>

<p>So if you check before executing:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    do_important()
</code></pre>

<p>With the above, your code will only execute when you're running it as the primary module (or intentionally call it from another script). </p>

<h2>An Even Better Way</h2>

<p>There's a Pythonic way to improve on this, though. </p>

<p>What if we want to run this business process from outside the module?</p>

<p>If we put the code we want to exercise as we develop and test in a function like this and then do our check for <code>'__main__'</code> immediately after:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    """business logic for when running this module as the primary one!"""
    setup()
    foo = do_important()
    bar = do_even_more_important(foo)
    for baz in bar:
        do_super_important(baz)
    teardown()

# Here's our payoff idiom!
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a final function for the end of our module that will run if we run the module as the primary module. </p>

<p>It will allow the module and its functions and classes to be imported into other scripts without running the <code>main</code> function, and will also allow the module (and its functions and classes) to be called when running from a different <code>'__main__'</code> module, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>import important
important.main()
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/__main__.html" rel="noreferrer">This idiom can also be found in the Python documentation in an explanation of the <code>__main__</code> module.</a> That text states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This module represents the (otherwise anonymous) scope in which the
  interpreter’s main program executes — commands read either from
  standard input, from a script file, or from an interactive prompt. It
  is this environment in which the idiomatic “conditional script” stanza
  causes a script to run:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<h2>What does <code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:</code> do?</h2>
</blockquote>
<p><code>__name__</code> is a global variable (in Python, global actually means on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#modules" rel="noreferrer">module level</a>) that exists in all namespaces. It is typically the module's name (as a <code>str</code> type).</p>
<p>As the only special case, however, in whatever Python process you run, as in mycode.py:</p>
<pre><code>python mycode.py
</code></pre>
<p>the otherwise anonymous global namespace is assigned the value of <code>'__main__'</code> to its <code>__name__</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, including <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/__main__.html" rel="noreferrer">the final lines</a></p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>at the end of your mycode.py script,</li>
<li>when it is the primary, entry-point module that is run by a Python process,</li>
</ul>
<p>will cause your script's uniquely defined <code>main</code> function to run.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using this construct: you can also import your code as a module in another script and then run the main function if and when your program decides:</p>

mycode.main()

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 95 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>There are lots of different takes here on the mechanics of the code in question, the "How", but for me none of it made sense until I understood the "Why". This should be especially helpful for new programmers.</p>

<p>Take file "ab.py":</p>

<pre><code>def a():
    print('A function in ab file');
a()
</code></pre>

<p>And a second file "xy.py":</p>

<pre><code>import ab
def main():
    print('main function: this is where the action is')
def x():
    print ('peripheral task: might be useful in other projects')
x()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is this code actually doing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you execute <code>xy.py</code>, you <code>import ab</code>. The import statement runs the module immediately on import, so <code>ab</code>'s operations get executed before the remainder of <code>xy</code>'s. Once finished with <code>ab</code>, it continues with <code>xy</code>.</p>

<p>The interpreter keeps track of which scripts are running with <code>__name__</code>. When you run a script - no matter what you've named it - the interpreter calls it <code>"__main__"</code>, making it the master or 'home' script that gets returned to after running an external script.</p>

<p>Any other script that's called from this <code>"__main__"</code> script is assigned its filename as its <code>__name__</code> (e.g., <code>__name__ == "ab.py"</code>). Hence, the line <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> is the interpreter's test to determine if it's interpreting/parsing the 'home' script that was initially executed, or if it's temporarily peeking into another (external) script. This gives the programmer flexibility to have the script behave differently if it's executed directly vs. called externally.</p>

<p>Let's step through the above code to understand what's happening, focusing first on the unindented lines and the order they appear in the scripts. Remember that function - or <code>def</code> - blocks don't do anything by themselves until they're called. What the interpreter might say if mumbled to itself:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open xy.py as the 'home' file; call it <code>"__main__"</code> in the <code>__name__</code> variable.</li>
<li>Import and open file with the <code>__name__ == "ab.py"</code>.</li>
<li>Oh, a function. I'll remember that.</li>
<li>Ok, function <code>a()</code>; I just learned that. Printing '<em>A function in ab file</em>'.</li>
<li>End of file; back to <code>"__main__"</code>!</li>
<li>Oh, a function. I'll remember that.</li>
<li>Another one.</li>
<li>Function <code>x()</code>; ok, printing '<em>peripheral task: might be useful in other projects</em>'.</li>
<li>What's this? An <code>if</code> statement. Well, the condition has been met (the variable <code>__name__</code> has been set to <code>"__main__"</code>), so I'll enter the <code>main()</code> function and print '<em>main function: this is where the action is</em>'.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom two lines mean: "If this is the <code>"__main__"</code> or 'home' script, execute the function called <code>main()</code>". That's why you'll see a <code>def main():</code> block up top, which contains the main flow of the script's functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why implement this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember what I said earlier about import statements? When you import a module it doesn't just 'recognize' it and wait for further instructions - it actually runs all the executable operations contained within the script. So, putting the meat of your script into the <code>main()</code> function effectively quarantines it, putting it in isolation so that it won't immediately run when imported by another script.</p>

<p>Again, there will be exceptions, but common practice is that <code>main()</code> doesn't usually get called externally. So you may be wondering one more thing: if we're not calling <code>main()</code>, why are we calling the script at all? It's because many people structure their scripts with standalone functions that are built to be run independent of the rest of the code in the file. They're then later called somewhere else in the body of the script. Which brings me to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the code works without it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, that's right. These separate functions <strong>can</strong> be called from an in-line script that's not contained inside a <code>main()</code> function. If you're accustomed (as I am, in my early learning stages of programming) to building in-line scripts that do exactly what you need, and you'll try to figure it out again if you ever need that operation again ... well, you're not used to this kind of internal structure to your code, because it's more complicated to build and it's not as intuitive to read.</p>

<p>But that's a script that probably can't have its functions called externally, because if it did it would immediately start calculating and assigning variables. And chances are if you're trying to re-use a function, your new script is related closely enough to the old one that there will be conflicting variables.</p>

<p>In splitting out independent functions, you gain the ability to re-use your previous work by calling them into another script. For example, "example.py" might import "xy.py" and call <code>x()</code>, making use of the 'x' function from "xy.py". (Maybe it's capitalizing the third word of a given text string; creating a NumPy array from a list of numbers and squaring them; or detrending a 3D surface. The possibilities are limitless.)</p>

<p>As by default (when module running as main, not imported) the <code>__name__</code> variable is set to <code>"__main__"</code>, and when it'll be imported the <code>__name__</code> variable will get a different value, most probably the name of the module (<code>'M'</code>).
This is helpful in running different variants of a modules together, and separating their specific input &amp; output statements and also if there are any test-cases.</p>

<p><strong>In short</strong>, use this '<code>if __name__ == "main"</code> ' block to prevent (certain) code from being run when the module is imported.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 67 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Put simply, <code>__name__</code> is a variable defined for each script that defines whether the script is being run as the main module or it is being run as an imported module.</p>

<p>So if we have two scripts;</p>

<pre><code>#script1.py
print "Script 1's name: {}".format(__name__)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>#script2.py
import script1
print "Script 2's name: {}".format(__name__)

<p>The output from executing script1 is</p>

<pre><code>Script 1's name: __main__

<p>And the output from executing script2 is:</p>

<pre><code>Script1's name is script1
Script 2's name: __main__
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>__name__</code> tells us which code is the 'main' module.
This is great, because you can just write code and not have to worry about structural issues like in C/C++, where, if a file does not implement a 'main' function then it cannot be compiled as an executable and if it does, it cannot then be used as a library.</p>

<p>Say you write a Python script that does something great and you implement a boatload of functions that are useful for other purposes. If I want to use them I can just import your script and use them without executing your program (given that your code only executes within the  <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> context). Whereas in C/C++ you would have to portion out those pieces into a separate module that then includes the file. Picture the situation below;</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hWLqr.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hWLqr.png" alt="Complicated importing in C"></a></p>

<p>The arrows are import links. For three modules each trying to include the previous modules code there are six files (nine, counting the implementation files) and five links. This makes it difficult to include other code into a C project unless it is compiled specifically as a library. Now picture it for Python:</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 47 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>When you run Python interactively the local <code>__name__</code> variable is assigned a value of <code>__main__</code>. Likewise, when you execute a Python module from the command line, rather than importing it into another module, its <code>__name__</code> attribute is assigned a value of <code>__main__</code>, rather than the actual name of the module. In this way, modules can look at their own <code>__name__</code> value to determine for themselves how they are being used, whether as support for another program or as the main application executed from the command line. Thus, the following idiom is quite common in Python modules:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Do something appropriate here, like calling a
    # main() function defined elsewhere in this module.
    main()
else:
    # Do nothing. This module has been imported by another

<p>However, if your Python script is used by a module, any code outside of the <code>if</code> statement will be executed, so <code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;</code> is used just to check if the program is used as a module or not, and therefore decides whether to run the code.</p>

<h2>What is <code>__name__</code>?</h2>
<p><code>__name__</code> is a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DunderAlias" rel="noreferrer">DunderAlias</a> - can be thought of as a global variable (accessible from modules) and works in a similar way to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13881395/in-python-what-is-a-global-statement"><code>global</code></a>.</p>
<p>It is a string (global as mentioned above) as indicated by <code>type(__name__)</code> (yielding <code>&lt;class 'str'&gt;</code>), and is an inbuilt standard for both <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="noreferrer">Python 3</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/__main__.html" rel="noreferrer">Python 2</a> versions.</p>
<h2>Where</h2>
<p>It can not only be used in scripts but can also be found in both the interpreter and modules/packages.</p>
<h3>Interpreter:</h3>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(__name__)
__main__
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Script:</h3>
<p><em>test_file.py</em>:</p>
<pre><code>print(__name__)
</code></pre>
<p>Resulting in <code>__main__</code></p>
<h3>Module or package:</h3>
<p><em>somefile.py:</em></p>
<pre><code>def somefunction():
    print(__name__)
</code></pre>
<p><em>test_file.py:</em></p>
<pre><code>import somefile
somefile.somefunction()
</code></pre>
<p>Resulting in <code>somefile</code></p>
<p>Notice that when used in a package or module, <code>__name__</code> takes the name of the file.  The path of the actual module or package path is not given, but has its own DunderAlias <code>__file__</code>, that allows for this.</p>
<p>You should see that, where <code>__name__</code>, where it is the main file (or program) will <em>always</em> return <code>__main__</code>, and if it is a module/package, or anything that is running off some other Python script, will return the name of the file where it has originated from.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>Being a variable means that it's value <em>can</em> be overwritten (&quot;can&quot; does not mean &quot;should&quot;), overwriting the value of <code>__name__</code> will result in a lack of readability.  So do not do it, for any reason.  If you need a variable define a new variable.</p>
<p>It is always assumed that the value of <code>__name__</code> to be <code>__main__</code> or the name of the file.  Once again changing this default value will cause more confusion that it will do good, causing problems further down the line.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; __name__ = 'Horrify' # Change default from __main__
&gt;&gt;&gt; if __name__ == 'Horrify': print(__name__)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; else: print('Not Horrify')
...
Horrify
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It is considered good practice in general to include the <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> in scripts.</p>
<h2>Now to answer <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code>:</h2>
<p><em>Now we know the behaviour of <code>__name__</code> things become clearer:</em></p>
<p>An <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="noreferrer"><code>if</code></a> is a flow control statement that contains the block of code will execute if the value given is true. We have seen that <code>__name__</code> can take either
<code>__main__</code> or the file name it has been imported from.</p>
<p>This means that if <code>__name__</code> is equal to <code>__main__</code> then the file must be the main file and must actually be running (or it is the interpreter), not a module or package imported into the script.</p>
<p>If indeed <code>__name__</code> does take the value of <code>__main__</code> then whatever is in that block of code will execute.</p>
<p>This tells us that if the file running is the main file (or you are running from the interpreter directly) then that condition must execute.  If it is a package then it should not, and the value will not be <code>__main__</code>.</p>
<h3>Modules</h3>
<p><code>__name__</code> can also be used in modules to define the name of a module</p>
<h3>Variants</h3>
<p>It is also possible to do other, less common but useful things with <code>__name__</code>, some I will show here:</p>
<h3>Executing only if the file is a module or package</h3>
<pre><code>if __name__ != '__main__':
    # Do some useful things 
</code></pre>
<h3>Running one condition if the file is the main one and another if it is not</h3>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Execute something
else:
    # Do some useful things
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use it to provide runnable help functions/utilities on packages and modules without the elaborate use of libraries.</p>
<p>It also allows modules to be run from the command line as main scripts, which can be also very useful.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 37 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I think it's best to break the answer in depth and in simple words:</p>

<p><code>__name__</code>: Every module in Python has a special attribute called <code>__name__</code>.
It is a built-in variable that returns the name of the module.</p>

<p><code>__main__</code>: Like other programming languages, Python too has an execution entry point, i.e., main. <code>'__main__'</code> <em>is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes</em>. Basically you have two ways of using a Python module: Run it directly as a script, or import it. When a module is run as a script, its <code>__name__</code> is set to <code>__main__</code>.</p>

<p>Thus, the value of the <code>__name__</code> attribute is set to <code>__main__</code> when the module is run as the main program. Otherwise the value of <code>__name__</code>  is set to contain the name of the module.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 30 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>There are a number of variables that the system (Python interpreter) provides for source files (modules).  You can get their values anytime you want, so, let us focus on the <strong>__name__</strong> variable/attribute:</p>

<p>When Python loads a source code file, it executes all of the code found in it. (Note that it doesn't call all of the methods and functions defined in the file, but it does define them.)</p>

<p>Before the interpreter executes the source code file though, it defines a few special variables for that file; <strong>__name__</strong> is one of those special variables that Python automatically defines for each source code file.</p>

<p>If Python is loading this source code file as the main program (i.e. the file you run), then it sets the special <strong>__name__</strong> variable for this file to have a value <strong>"__main__"</strong>.</p>

<p>If this is being imported from another module, <strong>__name__</strong> will be set to that module's name.</p>

<p>So, in your example in part:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
   lock = thread.allocate_lock()
   thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 1", 2, lock))
   thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 2", 2, lock))
</code></pre>

<p>means that the code block:</p>

<pre><code>lock = thread.allocate_lock()
thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 1", 2, lock))
thread.start_new_thread(myfunction, ("Thread #: 2", 2, lock))
</code></pre>

<p>will be executed only when you run the module directly; the code block will not execute if another module is calling/importing it because the value of <strong>__name__</strong> will not equal to "<strong>main</strong>" in that particular instance.</p>

<p>Hope this helps out.</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>is primarily to avoid the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html#importing-in-threaded-code" rel="noreferrer">import lock</a> problems that would arise from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46326059/">having code directly imported</a>. You want <code>main()</code> to run if your file was directly invoked (that's the <code>__name__ == "__main__"</code> case), but if your code was imported then the importer has to enter your code from the true main module to avoid import lock problems.</p>

<p>A side-effect is that you automatically sign on to a methodology that supports multiple entry points. You can run your program using <code>main()</code> as the entry point, <em>but you don't have to</em>. While <code>setup.py</code> expects <code>main()</code>, other tools use alternate entry points. For example, to run your file as a <code>gunicorn</code> process, you define an <code>app()</code> function instead of a <code>main()</code>. Just as with <code>setup.py</code>, <code>gunicorn</code> imports your code so you don't want it do do anything while it's being imported (because of the import lock issue).</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 21 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>If you are a beginner, probably the only answer you need right now is that <em>this code is unnecessary</em> for a simple script. It is only useful if you want to be able to <code>import</code> your script (or <code>unpickle</code> etc; see the other answers here for some other non-beginner scenarios).</p>
<p>In slightly different words, the <code>if __name__</code> guard is a mechanism for hiding code from other code. If you don't have a specific reason to hide something, don't: If you don't need to hide some code from <code>import</code>, don't put it behind this guard, and if you do, hide as little as possible.</p>
<p>In slightly more detail, let's say you have a simple script <code>fib.py</code> (adapted from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42773985/874188">this answer</a>):</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># XXX FIXME: useless (see below)
if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    n = int(input('Write a number: '))
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b &lt; n:
        a, b = b, a+b
    print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, b))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you simply run <code>python fib.py</code> it works fine. But <code>__name__</code> will always be <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> in this scenario, so the condition is actually unnecessary. The script could be simplified to just</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>n = int(input('Write a number: '))
a, b = 0, 1
while b &lt; n:
    a, b = b, a+b
print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, b))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can't <code>import fib</code> with the new version, but if you didn't plan to do that in the first place, this version is actually better, because it's simpler and clearer.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> want to be able to <code>import fib</code>, the first version is useless, too, because the useful code is in a section which will not run when you <code>import</code> this file (in which case <code>__name__</code> will not be <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>). The proper design in that case would be to refactor the code so that the useful parts are in a function you can run when you want to after you have <code>import</code>ed it.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def main():
    n = int(input('Write a number: '))
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b &lt; n:
        a, b = b, a+b
    print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, b))

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you <code>import fib</code>, the call to <code>main()</code> will not be executed; but when you run <code>python fib.py</code>, it will.</p>
<p>Actually, a better design still would be to isolate the reusable part (the actual calculation) from the user-visible input/output:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def fibn(n: int) -&gt; int:
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b &lt; n:
        a, b = b, a+b
    return b

def main() -&gt; None:
    n = int(input('Write a number: '))
    print('Fibonacci number %i: %i' % (n, fibn(n)))

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can <code>from fib import fibn</code> and call the <code>fibn()</code> function from the code which performs this <code>import</code>.</p>
<p>(I called the function <code>fibn()</code> just to make it clearer what is what in this example. In real life, you might call it <code>fib()</code> and do <code>from fib import fib</code>.)</p>
<p>Similarly, you could <code>import</code> and call the <code>main</code> function if you wanted to reuse it.</p>
<p>Returning to the code in the question, I would similarly move the code from the <code>if</code> into a function as well, so that callers can invoke that function if they want to.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>def main():

<p>This changes the scope of the <code>lock</code> variable; if the surrounding code needs access to it, you will need to make it <code>global</code> (or, perhaps, better, refactor <code>main</code> to <code>return lock</code>, and have the caller capture the value in a local variable of its own).</p>
<p>(Unlike in languages like C, the name <code>main</code> has no specific meaning to Python; but it's a common convention to use it as the name of the thing which will be run. You still have to actually explicitly call it, like <code>main()</code>, unlike in C.)</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Value of __name__ is: __main__
Going to call hello_world
I am inside hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose we call the above script from another script:</p>
<h3>Script <em>external_calling.py</em></h3>
<pre><code>import test

print(test.apple)
test.hello_world()

print(test.__name__)
</code></pre>
<p>When you execute this,</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>python external_calling.py
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>42
I am inside hello_world
test
</code></pre>
<p>So, the above is self-explanatory that when you call <em>test</em> from another script, if loop <code>__name__</code> in <code>test.py</code> will not execute.</p>

Every Java file typically contains one public class. You can use that class in two ways: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Call the class from other files. You just have to import it in the calling program.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the class stand alone, for testing purposes. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the latter case, the class should contain a public static void main() method. In Python this purpose is served by the globally defined label <code>'__main__'</code>.</p>

<p>It checks if a module is being imported or not.</p>
<p>In other words, the code within the <code>if</code> block will be executed only when the code runs directly. Here <code>directly</code> means <code>not imported</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see what it does using a simple code that prints the name of the module:</p>
<pre><code># test.py
def test():
   print('test module name=%s' %(__name__))

if __name__ == '__main__':
   print('call test()')
   test()

<p>If we run the code directly via <code>python test.py</code>, the module name is <code>__main__</code>:</p>

<p>Assume that you have two Python files, a.py and b.py. Now, <code>a.py</code> imports <code>b.py</code>. We run the <code>a.py</code> file, where the <code>import b.py</code> code is executed first. Before the rest of the <code>a.py</code> code runs, the code in the file <code>b.py</code> must run completely.</p>
<p>In the b.py code, there is some code that is exclusive to that file <code>b.py</code> and we don't want any other file (other than the <code>b.py</code> file), that has imported the b.py file, to run it.</p>
<p>So that is what this line of code checks. If it is the main file (i.e., <code>b.py</code>) running the code, which in this case it is not (<code>a.py</code> is the main file running), then only the code gets executed.</p>

<p>The other answers to this question are way too long.  The actual mechanics are quite simple and there are only two essential facts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pure Python modules are always created with the variable <code>__name__</code> set to the string <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Importing a module has the side-effect of changing the <code>__name__</code> variable to the base filename without the <code>.py</code> extension.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>How this information is used</h2>
<p>People write <code>__name__ == '__main__'</code> to test whether a module has been imported.</p>
<p>It is common to have some code that shouldn't run when an import occurs: Test code, one-time use code, a command-line front-end, or a web server front-end.</p>
<p>The idea is that person running a module directly wants these actions to happen, but a person importing the module just wants direct access to the functions, classes, and variables.</p>
<p>As you can see from the other answers, people seem to be able to talk endlessly about this topic, but it really is a simple thing and is easily mastered.  The Python tutorial <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#executing-modules-as-scripts" rel="noreferrer">covers this</a> in about two minutes worth of reading.  Don't let the other answers drown you with overexplaining :-)</p>

<pre><code>print(__name__) # It will print out __main__
</code></pre>

<p><code>__name__</code> is always equal to <code>__main__</code> whenever that file is <strong>run directly</strong> showing that this is the main file.</p>

<p>Create another file, <strong>b.py</strong>, in the same directory:</p>

<pre><code>import a  # Prints a
</code></pre>

<p>Run it. It will print <strong>a</strong>, i.e., the name of the file which <strong>is imported</strong>.</p>

<p>So, to show <strong>two different behavior of the same file</strong>, this is a commonly used trick:</p>

<pre><code># Code to be run when imported into another python file

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Code to be run only when run directly

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>When a Python file is executed it creates many special variables such as <code>__name__</code>. The variable <code>__name__</code> holds the name of the file. And the answer to your question is that</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
       # Do something
</code></pre>
<p>This means that if the name of the file being executed is running as the source file and <strong>not a module</strong> then it will run the code inside it. This can be proved with a simple example. Create two Python files, <code>foo.py</code> and <code>second.py</code>. Then in the <code>foo.py</code>, type this:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
       print(&quot;file is not imported&quot;)
else:
       print(&quot;file is imported&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And in the <code>second.py</code>, type this:</p>
<pre><code>import foo

if foo.__name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
       print(&quot;file is not imported&quot;)
else:
       print(&quot;file is imported&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to this, if you will do this <code>print(__name__)</code> then it will print <code>__main__</code>. Why?</p>
<p>Because the file is running as the <strong>main</strong> source and if you'll do <code>print(foo.__name__)</code> it will print <em>foo</em> because the default value of the <code>__name__</code> variable is the name of the file and by default I mean you can change it too. To do this, just go to the <code>foo.py</code> file and do this: <code>__name__ = &quot;name&quot;</code>. Then when you'll run the file, for example,</p>
<pre><code>__name__ = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
print(__name__)
</code></pre>
<p>then the output will be:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, World!
</code></pre>
