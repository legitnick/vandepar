<p>It's boilerplate code that protects users from accidentally invoking the script when they didn't intend to. Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. <code>import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard</code>), then the latter script will trigger the former to run <em>at import time</em> and <em>using the second script's command line arguments</em>. This is almost always a mistake.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Long Answer</h1>
<p>To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.</p>
<p>Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it sets a few special variables like <code>__name__</code>, and then</p>
</li>
<li><p>it executes all of the code found in the file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the <code>__name__</code> checks we always see in Python scripts.</p>
<h2>Code Sample</h2>
<p>Let's use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work.  Suppose the following is in a file called <code>foo.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code># Suppose this is foo.py.

print(&quot;before import&quot;)
import math

print(&quot;before function_a&quot;)
def function_a():
    print(&quot;Function A&quot;)

print(&quot;before function_b&quot;)
def function_b():
    print(&quot;Function B {}&quot;.format(math.sqrt(100)))

print(&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    function_a()
    function_b()
print(&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;)
</code></pre>
<h2>Special Variables</h2>
<p>When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the <code>__name__</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>When Your Module Is the Main Program</strong></p>
<p>If you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>python foo.py
</code></pre>
<p>the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> to the <code>__name__</code> variable, i.e.</p>
<pre><code># It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when run as the main program.
__name__ = &quot;__main__&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>When Your Module Is Imported By Another</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:</p>
<pre><code># Suppose this is in some other main program.
import foo
</code></pre>
<p>The interpreter will search for your <code>foo.py</code> file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> from the import statement to the <code>__name__</code> variable, i.e.</p>
<pre><code># It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when it's imported from another module.
__name__ = &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Executing the Module's Code</h2>
<p>After the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before import&quot;</code> (without quotes).</p>
</li>
<li><p>It loads the <code>math</code> module and assigns it to a variable called <code>math</code>. This is equivalent to replacing <code>import math</code> with the following (note that <code>__import__</code> is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># Find and load a module given its string name, &quot;math&quot;,
# then assign it to a local variable called math.
math = __import__(&quot;math&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before function_a&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It executes the <code>def</code> block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called <code>function_a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before function_b&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It executes the second <code>def</code> block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called <code>function_b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It prints the string <code>&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only When Your Module Is the Main Program</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>If your module is the main program, then it will see that <code>__name__</code> was indeed set to <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code> and it calls the two functions, printing the strings <code>&quot;Function A&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;Function B 10.0&quot;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>(<strong>instead</strong>) If your module is not the main program but was imported by another one, then <code>__name__</code> will be <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code>, not <code>&quot;__main__&quot;</code>, and it'll skip the body of the <code>if</code> statement.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Always</strong></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>It will print the string <code>&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;</code> in both situations.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>Summary</strong></em></p>
<p>In summary, here's what'd be printed in the two cases:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code># What gets printed if foo is the main program
before import
before function_a
before function_b
before __name__ guard
Function A
Function B 10.0
after __name__ guard
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code># What gets printed if foo is imported as a regular module
before import
before function_a
before function_b
before __name__ guard
after __name__ guard
</code></pre>
<h2>Why Does It Work This Way?</h2>
<p>You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this.  Well, sometimes you want to write a <code>.py</code> file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing <code>.py</code> files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. &quot;Running&quot; the script is a side effect of importing the script's module.</p>
<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Question: Can I have multiple <code>__name__</code> checking blocks?  Answer: it's strange to do so, but the language won't stop you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suppose the following is in <code>foo2.py</code>.  What happens if you say <code>python foo2.py</code> on the command-line? Why?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is foo2.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) # needed for some interpreters

def function_a():
    print(&quot;a1&quot;)
    from foo2 import function_b
    print(&quot;a2&quot;)
    function_b()
    print(&quot;a3&quot;)

def function_b():
    print(&quot;b&quot;)

print(&quot;t1&quot;)
if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    print(&quot;m1&quot;)
    function_a()
    print(&quot;m2&quot;)
print(&quot;t2&quot;)
      
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Now, figure out what will happen if you remove the <code>__name__</code> check in <code>foo3.py</code>:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is foo3.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) # needed for some interpreters

def function_a():
    print(&quot;a1&quot;)
    from foo3 import function_b
    print(&quot;a2&quot;)
    function_b()
    print(&quot;a3&quot;)

def function_b():
    print(&quot;b&quot;)

print(&quot;t1&quot;)
print(&quot;m1&quot;)
function_a()
print(&quot;m2&quot;)
print(&quot;t2&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>What will this do when used as a script?  When imported as a module?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code># Suppose this is in foo4.py
__name__ = &quot;__main__&quot;

def bar():
    print(&quot;bar&quot;)
    
print(&quot;before __name__ guard&quot;)
if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    bar()
print(&quot;after __name__ guard&quot;)

<pre><code>python myscript.py
</code></pre>

<p>all of the code that is at indentation level 0 gets executed.  Functions and classes that are defined are, well, defined, but none of their code gets run.  Unlike other languages, there's no <code>main()</code> function that gets run automatically - the <code>main()</code> function is implicitly all the code at the top level.</p>

<p>In this case, the top-level code is an <code>if</code> block.  <code>__name__</code> is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.  However, if a module is being run directly (as in <code>myscript.py</code> above), then <code>__name__</code> instead is set to the string <code>"__main__"</code>.  Thus, you can test whether your script is being run directly or being imported by something else by testing</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>If your script is being imported into another module, its various function and class definitions will be imported and its top-level code will be executed, but the code in the then-body of the <code>if</code> clause above won't get run as the condition is not met. As a basic example, consider the following two scripts:</p>

<pre><code># file one.py
def func():
    print("func() in one.py")

print("top-level in one.py")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("one.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("one.py is being imported into another module")
</code></pre>



<pre><code># file two.py
import one

print("top-level in two.py")
one.func()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("two.py is being run directly")
else:
    print("two.py is being imported into another module")
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if you invoke the interpreter as</p>

<pre><code>python one.py
</code></pre>

<p>The output will be</p>

<pre><code>top-level in one.py
one.py is being run directly
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>two.py</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>python two.py
</code></pre>

<p>You get</p>

<pre><code>top-level in one.py
one.py is being imported into another module
top-level in two.py
func() in one.py
two.py is being run directly
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, when module <code>one</code> gets loaded, its <code>__name__</code> equals <code>"one"</code> instead of <code>"__main__"</code>.</p>

  <h2>What does the <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> do?</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>To outline the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The global variable, <code>__name__</code>, in the module that is the entry point to your program, is <code>'__main__'</code>. Otherwise, it's the name you import the module by.</p></li>
<li><p>So, code under the <code>if</code> block will only run if the module is the entry point to your program.</p></li>
<li><p>It allows the code in the module to be importable by other modules, without executing the code block beneath on import.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Why do we need this?</p>

<h2>Developing and Testing Your Code</h2>

<p>Say you're writing a Python script designed to be used as a module:</p>

<pre><code>def do_important():
    """This function does something very important"""
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>could</em> test the module by adding this call of the function to the bottom:</p>

<pre><code>do_important()
</code></pre>

<p>and running it (on a command prompt) with something like:</p>

<pre><code>~$ python important.py
</code></pre>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>However, if you want to import the module to another script:</p>

<pre><code>import important
</code></pre>

<p>On import, the <code>do_important</code> function would be called, so you'd probably comment out your function call, <code>do_important()</code>, at the bottom. </p>

<pre><code># do_important() # I must remember to uncomment to execute this!
</code></pre>

<p>And then you'll have to remember whether or not you've commented out your test function call. And this extra complexity would mean you're likely to forget, making your development process more troublesome.</p>

<h2>A Better Way</h2>

<p>The <code>__name__</code> variable points to the namespace wherever the Python interpreter happens to be at the moment. </p>

<p>Inside an imported module, it's the name of that module. </p>

<p>But inside the primary module (or an interactive Python session, i.e. the interpreter's Read, Eval, Print Loop, or REPL) you are running everything from its <code>"__main__"</code>.</p>

<p>So if you check before executing:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    do_important()
</code></pre>

<p>With the above, your code will only execute when you're running it as the primary module (or intentionally call it from another script). </p>

<h2>An Even Better Way</h2>

<p>There's a Pythonic way to improve on this, though. </p>

<p>What if we want to run this business process from outside the module?</p>

<p>If we put the code we want to exercise as we develop and test in a function like this and then do our check for <code>'__main__'</code> immediately after:</p>

<pre><code>def main():
    """business logic for when running this module as the primary one!"""
    setup()
    foo = do_important()
    bar = do_even_more_important(foo)
    for baz in bar:
        do_super_important(baz)
    teardown()

# Here's our payoff idiom!
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a final function for the end of our module that will run if we run the module as the primary module. </p>

<p>It will allow the module and its functions and classes to be imported into other scripts without running the <code>main</code> function, and will also allow the module (and its functions and classes) to be called when running from a different <code>'__main__'</code> module, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>import important
important.main()
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/__main__.html" rel="noreferrer">This idiom can also be found in the Python documentation in an explanation of the <code>__main__</code> module.</a> That text states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This module represents the (otherwise anonymous) scope in which the
  interpreter’s main program executes — commands read either from
  standard input, from a script file, or from an interactive prompt. It
  is this environment in which the idiomatic “conditional script” stanza
  causes a script to run:</p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
