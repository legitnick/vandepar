<p>I tried many different things. Jumping on trampolines won't get me high enough, and the only thing that looks high enough is the crane, but I somehow can't jump that far when the plane (or... glider? I don't actually know what it really is.) shows up there.</p>

<p>How can I lick that thing, and what is the achievement I can get from it?</p>

On the bottom of the page, you can find the "Mile High Club â€” Lick the Hanging Glider" achievement, which I think is the one you are looking for.</p>

<p>Same as you tried: you must climb up the big crane and then jump on the glider when it's close enough to lick it. It's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub4elJoBN60">the last video</a>. Watch at 0:30 to see how to perform the jump to reach the glider.</p>
