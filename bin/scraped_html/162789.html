<p>I tried many different things. Jumping on trampolines won't get me high enough, and the only thing that looks high enough is the crane, but I somehow can't jump that far when the plane (or... glider? I don't actually know what it really is.) shows up there.</p>

<p>How can I lick that thing, and what is the achievement I can get from it?</p>
