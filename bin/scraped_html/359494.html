<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.c-point.com/javascript_tutorial/jsgrpComparison.htm" rel="noreferrer">Javascript Tutorial: Comparison Operators</a></p>

<p>The <code>==</code> operator will compare for equality <em>after doing any necessary type conversions</em>.  The <code>===</code> operator will <strong>not</strong> do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type <code>===</code> will simply return <code>false</code>. Both are equally quick.</p>

<p>To quote Douglas Crockford's excellent <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596517742" rel="noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>, and their evil twins <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then <code>===</code> produces <code>true</code> and <code>!==</code> produces <code>false</code>.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:</p>

<pre><code>'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>.  All of the comparisons just shown produce <code>false</code> with the <code>===</code> operator.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>A good point was brought up by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/165495/casebash">@Casebash</a> in the comments and in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/113570/philippe-leybaert">@Phillipe Laybaert's</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/957602/1288">answer</a> concerning objects.  For objects, <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> act consistently with one another (except in a special case).</p>

<pre><code>var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];

var c = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var d = { x: 1, y: 2 };

var e = "text";
var f = "te" + "xt";

a == b            // false
a === b           // false

c == d            // false
c === d           // false

e == f            // true
e === f           // true
</code></pre>

<p>The special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its <code>toString</code> or <code>valueOf</code> method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the <code>String</code> constructor.</p>

<pre><code>"abc" == new String("abc")    // true
"abc" === new String("abc")   // false
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>==</code> operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning <code>true</code>, but the <code>===</code> is seeing that they're not the same type and returning <code>false</code>.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you're trying to compare.  My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don't use the <code>String</code> constructor to create string objects from string literals.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 656 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>In the answers here, I didn't read anything about what <strong>equal</strong> means. Some will say that <code>===</code> means <strong>equal and of the same type</strong>, but that's not really true. It actually means that <strong>both operands reference the same object</strong>, or in case of <strong>value types, have the same value</strong>.</p>
<p>So, let's take the following code:</p>
<pre><code>var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];
var c = a;

var ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)
var ac_eq = (a === c); // true
</code></pre>
<p>The same here:</p>
<pre><code>var a = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var b = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var c = a;

var ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)
var ac_eq = (a === c); // true
</code></pre>
<p>Or even:</p>
<pre><code>var a = { };
var b = { };
var c = a;

var ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)
var ac_eq = (a === c); // true
</code></pre>
<p>This behavior is not always obvious. There's more to the story than being equal and being of the same type.</p>
<p>The rule is:</p>
<p><em><strong>For value types (numbers):</strong></em><br />
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have the same value and are of the same type</p>
<p><em><strong>For reference types:</strong></em><br />
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> reference the exact same object</p>
<p><em><strong>For strings:</strong></em><br />
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both strings and contain the exact same characters</p>
<hr />
<h2>Strings: the special case...</h2>
<p>Strings are not value types, but in Javascript they behave like value types, so they will be &quot;equal&quot; when the characters in the string are the same and when they are of the same length (as explained in the third rule)</p>
<p>Now it becomes interesting:</p>
<pre><code>var a = &quot;12&quot; + &quot;3&quot;;
var b = &quot;123&quot;;

alert(a === b); // returns true, because strings behave like value types
</code></pre>
<p>But how about this?:</p>
<pre><code>var a = new String(&quot;123&quot;);
var b = &quot;123&quot;;

alert(a === b); // returns false !! (but they are equal and of the same type)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought strings behave like value types? Well, it depends who you ask... In this case a and b are not the same type. <code>a</code> is of type <code>Object</code>, while <code>b</code> is of type <code>string</code>. Just remember that creating a string object using the <code>String</code> constructor creates something of type <code>Object</code> that behaves as a string <em>most of the time</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>If in doubt, read the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" rel="noreferrer">specification</a>!</strong></em></p>
<p>ECMA-262 is the specification for a scripting language of which JavaScript is a dialect. Of course in practice it matters more how the most important browsers behave than an esoteric definition of how something is supposed to be handled. But it is helpful to understand why <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>Please let me explain how to read the specification to clarify this question. I see that in this very old topic nobody had an answer for the very strange effect. So, if you can read a specification, this will help you in your profession tremendously. It is an acquired skill. So, let's continue.</p>
<p>Searching the PDF file for === brings me to page 56 of the specification: <strong>11.9.4. The Strict Equals Operator ( === )</strong>, and after wading through the specificationalese I find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11.9.6 The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm</strong><br>
The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. Such a comparison is performed as follows:<br>
  1. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  2. If Type(x) is Undefined, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  3. If Type(x) is Null, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  4. If Type(x) is not Number, go to step 11.<br>
  5. If x is <strong>NaN</strong>, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  6. If y is <strong>NaN</strong>, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  7. If x is the same number value as y, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  8. If x is +0 and y is −0, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  9. If x is −0 and y is +0, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
  10. Return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  11. If Type(x) is String, then return <strong>true</strong> if x and y are exactly the same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in corresponding positions); otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  12. If Type(x) is Boolean, return <strong>true</strong> if x and y are both <strong>true</strong> or both <strong>false</strong>; otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
  13. Return <strong>true</strong> if x and y refer to the same object or if they refer to objects joined to each other (see 13.1.2). Otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting is step 11. Yes, strings are treated as value types. But this does not explain why <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;</strong>. Do we have a browser not conforming to ECMA-262?</p>
<p>Not so fast!</p>
<p>Let's check the types of the operands. Try it out for yourself by wrapping them in <strong>typeof()</strong>. I find that <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;)</strong> is an object, and step 1 is used: return <strong>false</strong> if the types are different.</p>
<p>If you wonder why <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;)</strong> does not return a string, how about some exercise reading a specification? Have fun!</p>

<p>Aidiakapi wrote this in a comment below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the specification</p>
<p><strong>11.2.2 The new Operator</strong>:</p>

<p>With other words, if String wouldn't be of type Object it couldn't be used with the new operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>new</strong> always returns an Object, even for <strong>String</strong> constructors, too. And alas! The value semantics for strings (see step 11) is lost.</p>
<p>And this finally means: <strong>new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>What do you get when you compare an empty string <code>""</code> with the number zero <code>0</code>?</p>

<p><code>true</code></p>

<p>Yep, that's right according to <code>==</code> an empty string and the number zero are the same time.</p>

<p>And it doesn't end there, here's another one:</p>

<pre><code>'0' == false // true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Things get really weird with arrays.</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1] == true // true
[] == false // true
[[]] == false // true
[0] == false // true
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then weirder with strings</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1,2,3] == '1,2,3' // true - REALLY?!
'\r\n\t' == 0 // true - Come on!
</code></pre>

<p>It get's worse:</p>

<p><strong>When is equal not equal?</strong></p>

<pre><code>let A = ''  // empty string
let B = 0   // zero
let C = '0' // zero string

A == B // true - ok... 
B == C // true - so far so good...
A == C // **FALSE** - Plot twist!
</code></pre>

<p>Let me say that again:</p>

<pre><code>(A == B) &amp;&amp; (B == C) // true
(A == C) // **FALSE**
</code></pre>

<p>And this is just the crazy stuff you get with primitives.</p>

<p>It's a whole new level of crazy when you use <code>==</code> with objects.</p>

<p>At this point your probably wondering...</p>

<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p>

<p>Well it's because unlike "triple equals" (<code>===</code>) which just checks if two values are the same.</p>

<p><code>==</code> does a <strong><em>whole bunch of other stuff</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It has special handling for functions, special handling for nulls, undefined, strings, you name it.</p>

<p>It get's pretty wacky.</p>

<p>In fact, if you tried to write a function that does what <code>==</code> does it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function isEqual(x, y) { // if `==` were a function
    if(typeof y === typeof x) return y === x;
    // treat null and undefined the same
    var xIsNothing = (y === undefined) || (y === null);
    var yIsNothing = (x === undefined) || (x === null);

    if(xIsNothing || yIsNothing) return (xIsNothing &amp;&amp; yIsNothing);

    if(typeof y === "function" || typeof x === "function") {
        // if either value is a string 
        // convert the function into a string and compare
        if(typeof x === "string") {
            return x === y.toString();
        } else if(typeof y === "string") {
            return x.toString() === y;
        } 
        return false;
    }

    if(typeof x === "object") x = toPrimitive(x);
    if(typeof y === "object") y = toPrimitive(y);
    if(typeof y === typeof x) return y === x;

    // convert x and y into numbers if they are not already use the "+" trick
    if(typeof x !== "number") x = +x;
    if(typeof y !== "number") y = +y;
    // actually the real `==` is even more complicated than this, especially in ES6
    return x === y;
}

function toPrimitive(obj) {
    var value = obj.valueOf();
    if(obj !== value) return value;
    return obj.toString();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So what does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>It means <code>==</code> is complicated.</p>

<p>Because it's complicated it's hard to know what's going to happen when you use it.</p>

<p>Which means you could end up with bugs.</p>

<p><strong>So the moral of the story is...</strong></p>

<p>Make your life less complicated.</p>

<p>Use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code>.</p>

<p>For <strong>"a == b"</strong> to evaluate to true a and b need to be the <strong>same value</strong>.</p>

<p>In the case of <strong>"a === b"</strong> a and b must be the <strong>same value</strong> and also the <strong>same type</strong> for it to evaluate to true.  </p>

<p><code>==</code> means <strong>comparison</strong> between operands <strong>with</strong> type coercion</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>===</code> means <strong>comparison</strong> between operands <strong>without</strong> type coercion.</p>
<p>Type coercion in JavaScript means automatically converting data types to other data types.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>123 == &quot;123&quot;  // Returns true, because JS coerces string &quot;123&quot; to number 123
              // and then goes on to compare `123 == 123`.

123 === &quot;123&quot; // Returns false, because JS does not coerce values of different types here.

<p>You can easily test it. Paste following code in an HTML file and open it in browser</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The equality (<code>==</code>) operator converts the operands if they are not of the same type, then applies strict comparison. If either operand is a number or a boolean, the operands are converted to numbers if possible; else if either operand is a string, the string operand is converted to a number if possible. If both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares internal references which are equal when operands refer to the same object in memory.</p>
