<p>Off the top of my head I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Watching replays with commentary from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/hdstarcraft" rel="noreferrer">youtube.com/hdstarcraft</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/huskystarcraft" rel="noreferrer">youtube.com/huskystarcraft</a></li>
<li>Watching live gamecasts on <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/video/userstream.php" rel="noreferrer">Team Liquid's user streams page</a></li>
<li>Following the <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/index.php?show_part=34" rel="noreferrer">Team Liquid Starcraft 2 Strategy forum</a></li>
</ul>

<p>...?</p>

  <p>And if it matters at all, apache@localhost is not the name of the user account that I use to get into the database. I don't have any user accounts with the name apache in them at all for that matter.</p>

<p>If it is saying 'apache@localhost' the username is not getting passed correctly to the MySQL connection. 'apache' is normally the user that runs the httpd process (at least on Redhat-based systems) and if no username is passed during the connection MySQL uses whomever is calling for the connection.</p>

<p>If you do the connection right in your script, not in a called file, do you get the same error?</p>
