<p><em>Unslaad Krosis</em>, literally means, "Eternal sorrow", according to <a href="http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language">UESP</a>, and the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Draugr">lore page</a> on draugr confirms that they do indeed say it.</p>

<p>However, the draugr were in life the servants of dragon priests, and upon their priest's death they would be entombed with him as his eternal servants and guardians; there appears to be nothing unwilling about it, and the lore article even specifically debunks the common Nord misconception that draugr are cursed. Draugr are, in fact, the undead servants and guardians of their immortal dragon priests.</p>

<p>This leads me to conclude that they are not, in fact, apologizing to the Dovahkiin as they attempt to disembowel him/her, especially alongside another common phrase listed in the aforementioned lore article, <em>Daanik Ah Dov</em>, or "Doomed dragonhunter", which appears to clearly be a threat.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, offer a clarification of the meaning of <em>Unslaad Krosis</em> in the context of the draugr mutterings, other than to offer my personal observation that dragon language appears to be at least somewhat idiomatic, and that oftentimes words seem to have deeper philosophical meanings than what a direct English translation would suggest.</p>

"Krosis" can mean both "sorry" (as Paarthurnax uses it) and "sorrow," apparently. Otherwise we'd have <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Krosis_%28creature%29" rel="noreferrer">a Dragon Priest named "Sorry."</a> It would seem like Paarthurnax's usage is less literal than elsewhere.</p>

<p>The word wall for <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Storm_Call" rel="noreferrer">the last word of Storm Call</a> uses it thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Qethsegol vahrukiv sahsunaar<br>
  Do daniik vundeheim ag<br>
  Nahlaas naal qo do<br>
  Unslaad krosis</p>
  
  <p>(This) stone commemorates (the) villagers<br>
  of doomed Vundeheim, burned<br>
  alive by (the) Lightning of<br>
  Unending Sorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for draugr being held against their wishes, <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Amongst_the_Draugr" rel="noreferrer">there's some lore on a researcher who managed to gain their trust and infiltrate them</a>. They seem more fiercely territorial than anything.</p>
