</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 7464 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Assuming the hash of the commit you want is <code>c5f567</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout c5f567 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout" rel="noreferrer">git checkout</a> man page gives more information.</p>
<p>If you want to revert to the commit before <code>c5f567</code>, append <code>~1</code> (where 1 is the number of commits you want to go back, it can be anything):</p>
<pre><code>git checkout c5f567~1 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
</code></pre>
<p>As a side note, I've always been uncomfortable with this command because it's used for both ordinary things (changing between branches) and unusual, destructive things (discarding changes in the working directory).</p>
<hr />
<p>There is also a new <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore" rel="noreferrer"><code>git restore</code></a> command that is specifically designed for restoring working copy files that have been modified. If your git is new enough you can use this command, but the documentation comes with a warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 733 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You can quickly review the changes made to a file using the diff command:</p>

<pre><code>git diff &lt;commit hash&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then to revert a specific file to that commit use the reset command:</p>

<pre><code>git reset &lt;commit hash&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You may need to use the <code>--hard</code> option if you have local modifications.</p>

<p>A good workflow for managaging waypoints is to use tags to cleanly mark points in your timeline. I can't quite understand your last sentence but what you may want is diverge a branch from a previous point in time. To do this, use the handy checkout command:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;commit hash&gt;
git checkout -b &lt;new branch name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can then rebase that against your mainline when you are ready to merge those changes:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;my branch&gt;
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge &lt;my branch&gt;
</code></pre>

See highlights of changes on <a href="https://github.blog/2019-08-16-highlights-from-git-2-23/" rel="noreferrer">github blog</a>.</p>

<p>The default behaviour of this command is to restore the state of a working tree with the content coming from the <code>source</code> parameter (which in your case will be a commit hash).</p>

<p>So based on Greg Hewgill's answer (assuming the commit hash is <code>c5f567</code>) the command would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>git restore --source=c5f567 file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you want to restore to the content of one commit before c5f567:</p>

<pre><code>git restore --source=c5f567~1 file1/to/restore file2/to/restore

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 58 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You have to be careful when you say "rollback".  If you used to have one version of a file in commit $A, and then later made two changes in two separate commits $B and $C (so what you are seeing is the third iteration of the file), and if you say "I want to roll back to the first one", do you really mean it?  </p>

<p>If  you want to get rid of the changes both the second and the third iteration, it is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout $A file
</code></pre>

<p>and then you commit the result.  The command asks "I want to check out the file from the state recorded by the commit $A".</p>

<p>On the other hand, what you meant is to get rid of the change the second iteration (i.e. commit $B) brought in, while keeping what commit $C did to the file, you would want to revert $B</p>

<pre><code>$ git revert $B
</code></pre>

<p>Note that whoever created commit $B may not have been very disciplined and may have committed totally unrelated change in the same commit, and this revert may touch files other than <em>file</em> you see offending changes, so you may want to check the result carefully after doing so.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>git checkout &lt;my branch&gt;
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge &lt;my branch&gt;

<hr>

<p>Assume you have</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>---o----o----o----o  master
    \---A----B       &lt;my branch&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The first two commands ...
commit
    git checkout 
    git rebase master</p>

<p>... check out the branch of changes you want to apply to the <code>master</code> branch. The <code>rebase</code> command takes the commits from <code>&lt;my branch&gt;</code> (that are not found in <code>master</code>) and reapplies them to the head of <code>master</code>. In other words, the parent of the first commit in <code>&lt;my branch&gt;</code> is no longer a previous commit in the <code>master</code> history, but the current head of <code>master</code>. The two commands are the same as:</p>

<pre><code>git rebase master &lt;my branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It might be easier to remember this command as both the "base" and "modify" branches are explicit.</p>

<p>. The final history result is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>---o----o----o----o   master
                   \----A'----B'  &lt;my branch&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The final two commands ...</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git merge &lt;my branch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... do a fast-forward merge to apply all <code>&lt;my branch&gt;</code> changes onto <code>master</code>. Without this step, the rebase commit does not get added to <code>master</code>. The final result is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>---o----o----o----o----A'----B'  master, &lt;my branch&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>master</code> and <code>&lt;my branch&gt;</code> both reference <code>B'</code>. Also, from this point it is safe to delete the <code>&lt;my branch&gt;</code> reference.</p>

<p>If you want to revert changes from one commit on a single file only, just as <code>git revert</code> would do but only for one file (or say a subset of the commit files), I suggest to use both <code>git diff</code> and <code>git apply</code> like that (with <code>&lt;sha&gt;</code> = the hash of the commit you want to revert) :</p>

<pre><code>git diff &lt;sha&gt;^ &lt;sha&gt; path/to/file.ext | git apply -R
