<p>I've already figured out that I can put a male vault dweller and a female vault dweller together in some residential quarters, and and eventually, if they hit it off, the lady will replace her vault suit with a yellow sweater and a decidedly pregnant figure. </p>

<p>Good enough.</p>

<p>But how long does it take her to deliver the child? Do I have to induce it through some sort of tapping ritual or placing her in the correct room? Does the pregnant dweller need to stay in the living quarters, or can I put her to work in my Diner or Water Treatment Facility? Do the SPECIAL stars of the parents matter?</p>

<p>Tell me everything about <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll-lia-FEIY">how to make babies</a> and what I can do to control the process. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/vhosts/domain.tld/httpdocs&gt;
php_admin_value open_basedir "/var/www/vhosts/domain.tld/httpdocs:/var/www/vhosts/domain.tld/zend"

<p>you can also completely remove the restriction with</p>

php_admin_value open_basedir none
