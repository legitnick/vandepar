</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 11192 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The answer has been split depending on whether there is one remote repository configured or multiple. The reason for this is that for the single remote case, some of the commands can be simplified as there is less ambiguity.</p>
<p><strong>Updated for Git 2.23:</strong> For older versions, see the section at the end.</p>
<h2>With One Remote</h2>
<p>In both cases, start by fetching from the remote repository to make sure you have all the latest changes downloaded.</p>
<pre><code>$ git fetch
</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -v -a

...
remotes/origin/test
</code></pre>
<p>The branches that start with <code>remotes/*</code> can be thought of as read only copies of the remote branches. To work on a branch you need to create a local branch from it. This is done with the Git command <code>switch</code> (since Git 2.23) by giving it the name of the remote branch (minus the remote name):</p>
<pre><code>$ git switch test
</code></pre>
<p>In this case Git is guessing (can be disabled with <code>--no-guess</code>) that you are trying to checkout and track the remote branch with the same name.</p>
<h2>With Multiple Remotes</h2>
<p>In the case where multiple remote repositories exist, the remote repository needs to be explicitly named.</p>
<p>As before, start by fetching the latest remote changes:</p>
<pre><code>$ git fetch origin
</code></pre>
<p>This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -v -a
</code></pre>
<p>With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in with <code>-c</code> to create a new local branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ git switch -c test origin/test
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about using <code>git switch</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ man git-switch
</code></pre>
<p>I also created the image below for you to share the differences, look at how to fetch works, and also how it's different to pull:</p>

<h2>Prior to Git 2.23</h2>
<p><code>git switch</code> was added in Git 2.23, prior to this <code>git checkout</code> was used to switch branches.</p>
<p>To checkout out with only a single remote repository:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout test
</code></pre>
<p>if there there are multiple remote repositories configured it becomes a bit longer</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b test &lt;name of remote&gt;/test
</code></pre>

<pre><code>git checkout test

<p>(note that it is 'test' not 'origin/test') to perform magical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM" rel="noreferrer" title="Do What I Mean">DWIM</a>-mery and create local branch 'test' for you, for which upstream would be remote-tracking branch 'origin/test'.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <code>* (no branch)</code> in <code>git branch</code> output means that you are on unnamed branch, in so called &quot;detached HEAD&quot; state (HEAD points directly to commit, and is not symbolic reference to some local branch).  If you made some commits on this unnamed branch, you can always create local branch off current commit:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b test HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>A more modern approach as suggested in the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@Dennis: <code>git checkout &lt;non-branch&gt;</code>, for example <code>git checkout origin/test</code> results in detached HEAD / unnamed branch, while <code>git checkout test</code> or <code>git checkout -b test origin/test</code> results in local
branch <code>test</code> (with remote-tracking branch <code>origin/test</code> as <em>upstream</em>) –

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 752 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>In this case, you probably want to create a local <code>test</code> branch which is tracking the remote <code>test</code> branch:</p>

<p>In earlier versions of <code>git</code>, you needed an explicit <code>--track</code> option, but that is the default now when you are branching off a remote branch.</p>
<p>To create the local branch <strong>and</strong> switch to it, use:</p>

<p>While the first and selected answer is technically <em>correct</em>, there's the possibility you have not yet retrieved all objects and refs from the remote repository. If that is the case, you'll receive the following error:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b remote_branch origin/remote_branch
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>fatal: git checkout: updating paths is incompatible with switching branches.<br>
  Did you intend to checkout 'origin/remote_branch' which can not be resolved as commit?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>If you receive this message, you must first do a <code>git fetch origin</code> where <code>origin</code> is the name of the remote repository prior to running <code>git checkout remote_branch</code>. Here's a full example with responses:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 140, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (30/30), done.
remote: Total 69 (delta 36), reused 66 (delta 33)
Unpacking objects: 100% (69/69), done.

$ git checkout demo
Branch demo set up to track remote branch demo from origin.

<p>As you can see, running <code>git fetch origin</code> retrieved any remote branches we were not yet setup to track on our local machine. From there, since we now have a ref to the remote branch, we can simply run <code>git checkout remote_branch</code> and we'll gain the benefits of remote tracking.</p>

<p>Using <code>git switch</code> rather than <code>git checkout</code>. More details are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24384951/confused-by-git-checkout/57066202#57066202">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>I think the answer is obsolete. Git split some functions of <code>checkout</code> to <code>switch</code> and <code>restore</code> now.</p>
<p>The following is my summary:</p>
<p>If you want to update something for a remote branch, you should create a local branch to &quot;track&quot; the remote branch. You can update anything you want in local and finally push to remote. If you check out to the remote branch directly after cloning your repository, you may see the &quot;detached HEAD&quot; status and the following message from Git:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Note: switching to 'origin/asd'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at d3e1083 Update a
</code></pre>
<p>So how can we create a local branch to track a remote branch?</p>
<p>To create a local branch to track a remote branch, you can use <code>git checkout &lt;remote branch name&gt;</code> or <code>git switch &lt;remote branch name&gt;</code>. If you have a file or folder has same name as your remote branch name, <code>git checkout</code> would output some error message, but <code>git switch</code> can work normally!</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>See all branches, and we want to create a local branch to track the remote branch <code>remotes/origin/asd</code>, and we also have the file name <code>asd</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master
  remotes/origin/asd
  remotes/origin/ereres
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/zxc
$ ls
a  asd
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>The filename is same as remote branch, and Git should output some error messages if we are using the <code>git checkout</code> command to create a local branch to track a remote branch</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>$ git checkout asd
fatal: 'asd' could be both a local file and a tracking branch.

<ol>
<li>Git looks on <code>xxx</code> as a branch name at first, but there isn't any branch named test.</li>

<p>For example, I tried to checkout a remote branch named <code>#9773</code>, but the command didn't work properly, as shown in the picture below:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yK8Rb.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yK8Rb.png" alt="Enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>For some reason, I wondered if the sharp symbol (#) could have something to do with it, and then I tried surrounding the branch name with single quotes, like <code>'#9773'</code> rather than just <code>#9773</code>, and fortunately it worked fine.</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>git checkout -b '#9773' origin/'#9773'
</code></pre>

<pre><code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;
git pull &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 7 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><code>git fetch --all</code></p>
<p>would fetch all the remote branches to your local</p>
<p><code>git checkout test</code></p>
<p>would switch you to the test branch</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p><strong>Working Commands</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>git fetch origin 'remote_branch':'local_branch_name'</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>git switch 'local_branch_name'</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>git pull origin 'remote_branch':'local_branch_name'</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is for fetching the branch and creating a local branch from a remote branch.</p>
<p>The second one is for switching to the local branch.</p>
<p>The third is for pulling the latest changes of remote to the local branch.</p>
