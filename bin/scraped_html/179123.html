</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 18105 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><h1>Amending the most recent commit message</h1>
<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>git commit --amend
</code></pre>
<p>will open your editor, allowing you to change the commit message of the most recent commit. Additionally, you can set the commit message directly in the command line with:</p>
<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>git commit --amend -m &quot;New commit message&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>…however, this can make multi-line commit messages or small corrections more cumbersome to enter.</p>
<p>Make sure you don't have any working copy changes <em>staged</em> before doing this or they will get committed too. (<em>Unstaged</em> changes will not get committed.)</p>
<h2>Changing the message of a commit that you've already pushed to your remote branch</h2>
<p>If you've already pushed your commit up to your remote branch, then - after amending your commit locally (as described above) - you'll also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41003071/why-must-i-force-push-after-changing-a-commit-message">need to force push the commit</a> with:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; --force
# Or
git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt; -f
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Warning: force-pushing will overwrite the remote branch with the state of your local one</strong>. If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have in your local branch, you <em>will</em> lose those commits.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: be cautious about amending commits that you have already shared with other people.</strong> Amending commits essentially <em>rewrites</em> them to have different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" rel="noreferrer">SHA</a> IDs, which poses a problem if other people have copies of the old commit that you've rewritten. Anyone who has a copy of the old commit will need to synchronize their work with your newly re-written commit, which can sometimes be difficult, so make sure you coordinate with others when attempting to rewrite shared commit history, or just avoid rewriting shared commits altogether.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Perform an interactive rebase</h3>
<p>Another option is to use interactive rebase.
This allows you to edit any message you want to update even if it's not the latest message.</p>
<p>In order to do a Git squash, follow these steps:</p>
<pre><code>// n is the number of commits up to the last commit you want to be able to edit
git rebase -i HEAD~n
</code></pre>
<p>Once you squash your commits - choose the <code>e/r</code> for editing the message:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVcm9.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVcm9.png" alt="Screenshot of terminal while editing commit" /></a></p>
<h3>Important note about interactive rebase</h3>
<p>When you use <code>git rebase -i HEAD~n</code> there can be <strong>more</strong> than n commits. Git will &quot;collect&quot; all the commits in the last n commits, and if there was a merge somewhere in between that range you will see all the commits as well, so the outcome will be n + .</p>
<h3>Good tip:</h3>
<p>If you have to do it for more than a single branch and you might face conflicts when amending the content, set up <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35415925/is-it-possible-to-setup-git-merge-for-automatic-resolving-git-rerere/35417944#35417944"><code>git rerere</code></a> and let Git resolve those conflicts automatically for you.</p>

<p>ProTip™: Don't be afraid to experiment with "dangerous" commands that rewrite history* — Git doesn't delete your commits for 90 days by default; you can find them in the reflog:</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset @~3   # Go back three commits
$ git reflog
c4f708b HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to @~3
2c52489 HEAD@{1}: commit: more changes
4a5246d HEAD@{2}: commit: make important changes
e8571e4 HEAD@{3}: commit: make some changes
... earlier commits ...
$ git reset 2c52489
... and you're back where you started
</code></pre>

<p>* <em>Watch out for options like <code>--hard</code> and <code>--force</code> though — they can discard data.</em>
*  <em>Also, don't rewrite history on any branches you're collaborating on.</em></p>

<p>Yet another way to do this is to delete the last commit, but keep its changes so that you won't lose your work. You can then do another commit with the corrected message. This would look something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 91 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>On this question there are a lot of answers, but none of them explains in super detail how to change older commit messages using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29" rel="noreferrer">Vim</a>. I was stuck trying to do this myself, so here I'll write down in detail how I did this especially for people who have no experience in Vim!</p>

<p>I wanted to change my five latest commits that I already pushed to the server. This is quite 'dangerous' because if someone else already pulled from this, you can mess things up by changing the commit messages. However, when you’re working on your own little branch and are sure no one pulled it you can change it like this:</p>

<p>Let's say you want to change your five latest commits, and then you type this in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>git rebase -i HEAD~5
</code></pre>

<p>*Where 5 is the number of commit messages you want to change (so if you want to change the 10th to last commit, you type in 10).</p>

<p>This command will get you into Vim there you can ‘edit’ your commit history. You’ll see your last five commits at the top like this:</p>

<pre><code>pick &lt;commit hash&gt; commit message
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of <code>pick</code> you need to write <code>reword</code>. You can do this in Vim by typing in <code>i</code>. That makes you go in to <em>insert</em> mode. (You see that you’re in insert mode by the word <em>INSERT</em> at the bottom.) For the commits you want to change, type in <code>reword</code> instead of <code>pick</code>.</p>

<p>Then you need to save and quit this screen. You do that by first going in to ‘command-mode’ by pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd>button (you can check that you’re in command-mode if the word <em>INSERT</em> at the bottom has disappeared). Then you can type in a command by typing <code>:</code>. The command to save and quit is <code>wq</code>. So if you type in <code>:wq</code> you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>Then Vim will go over every commit message you want to reword, and here you can actually change the commit messages. You’ll do this by going into insert mode, changing the commit message, going into the command-mode, and save and quit. Do this five times and you’re out of Vim!</p>

<p>Then, if you already pushed your wrong commits, you need to <code>git push --force</code> to overwrite them. Remember that <code>git push --force</code> is quite a dangerous thing to do, so make sure that no one pulled from the server since you pushed your wrong commits!</p>

<p>Now you have changed your commit messages!</p>

<p>(As you see, I'm not that experienced in Vim, so if I used the wrong 'lingo' to explain what's happening, feel free to correct me!)</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase-reword &lt;commit-or-refname&gt;

<p>It is named after the action on rebase interactive to amend a commit: "reword". See <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history">this post</a> and <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">man</a> -section interactive mode-</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> force pushing your changes will overwrite the remote branch with your local one. Make sure that you aren't going to be overwriting anything that you want to keep. Also be cautious about force pushing an amended (rewritten) commit if anyone else shares the branch with you, because they'll need to rewrite their own history if they have the old copy of the commit that you've just rewritten.</p>

<pre><code> git commit --amend -m "Your new message"
</code></pre>

<p>If you're working on a specific branch do this:</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend -m "BRANCH-NAME: new message"
</code></pre>

<p>If you've already pushed the code with the wrong message, and you need to be careful when changing the message. That is, after you change the commit message and try pushing it again, you end up with having issues. To make it smooth, follow these steps.</p>

<p><strong>Please read my entire answer before doing it.</strong></p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend -m "BRANCH-NAME : your new message"

git push -f origin BRANCH-NAME                # Not a best practice. Read below why?
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> When you use the force push directly you might end up with code issues that other developers are working on the same branch. So to avoid those conflicts, you need to pull the code from your branch before making the <strong>force push</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> git commit --amend -m "BRANCH-NAME : your new message"
 git pull origin BRANCH-NAME
 git push -f origin BRANCH-NAME
</code></pre>

<p>This is the best practice when changing the commit message, if it was already pushed.</p>
