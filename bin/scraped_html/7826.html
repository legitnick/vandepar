<p>Setting the SkipIntroVideo = 1 in usersettings.ini does not actually shorten the load time. Nor does removing the movie file from the root install directory.</p>

<p>You who answer to the contrary (@FallenAngelEyes &amp; @Oak), I challenge you to actually get out a stopwatch and test it. Results below.</p>

<p><strong>Movie on:</strong> 20.4 seconds</p>

<p><strong>SkipIntroVideo Set:</strong> 19.95 seconds</p>

<p><strong>Movie File Deleted:</strong> 20.4 seconds</p>

<p><strong>File deleted and SkipIntroVideo Set</strong>: 20.1 seconds</p>

<p>Test procedure used:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click the DirectX 10 &amp; 11 launch option. <em>Start Time</em></p></li>
<li><p>Click the mouse repeatedly</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stop Time</em> when the ESRB Notice is seen.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>p.s.
+1 to bwarner's original comment on the first answer about the load time not improving </p>

<p>p.s.s.
I realize now that because everyone has a different time before they can click to cancel the movie, it's probably just the game itself loading and not some bug where they force you to watch a certain amount of the movie. So it may not be fixable at all by Firaxis except by improving load times.</p>

<p>Instead of having you wait for the old man to start talking and then clicking the mouse.</p>
