<pre><code>where `books`.`shelfTagNum`=`shelf`.`shelfNum`
</code></pre>

<p>In order to match rows from the <code>books</code> and <code>shelf</code> tables, you need to have terms from each in your <code>where</code> clause - otherwise, you're just performing a no-operation check on the rows of <code>books</code>, since every row's <code>shelfNum</code> will be equal to its <code>shelfNum</code>.</p>

<p>As @fixme.myopenid.com suggests, you could also go the explicit <code>JOIN</code> route, but it's not necessary.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>if you want to be sure you're doing a join instead of a cross product, you should state it explicitly in the SQL, thus:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT books.bookTagNum,books.shelfNum, shelf.shelfTagNum, books.title
FROM books INNER JOIN shelf ON books.shelfNum = shelf.shelfTagNum
ORDER BY shelf.shelfTagNum
</code></pre>

<p>(which will return only those rows which exist in both tables), or:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT books.bookTagNum,books.shelfNum, shelf.shelfTagNum, books.title
FROM books LEFT OUTER JOIN shelf ON books.shelfNum = shelf.shelfTagNum
ORDER BY shelf.shelfTagNum
</code></pre>

<p>(which will return all rows from books), or:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT books.bookTagNum,books.shelfNum, shelf.shelfTagNum, books.title
FROM books RIGHT OUTER JOIN shelf ON books.shelfNum = shelf.shelfTagNum
ORDER BY shelf.shelfTagNum
</code></pre>

<p>(which will return all rows from shelf)</p>
