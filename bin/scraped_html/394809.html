</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 8806 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Yes, it was <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-September/056846.html" rel="noreferrer" title="[Python-Dev] Conditional Expression Resolution">added</a> in version 2.5. The expression syntax is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>a if condition else b
</code></pre>
<p>First <code>condition</code> is evaluated, then exactly one of either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is evaluated and returned based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" rel="noreferrer" title="Boolean data type">Boolean</a> value of <code>condition</code>. If <code>condition</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, then <code>a</code> is evaluated and returned but <code>b</code> is ignored, or else when <code>b</code> is evaluated and returned but <code>a</code> is ignored.</p>
<p>This allows short-circuiting because when <code>condition</code> is true only <code>a</code> is evaluated and <code>b</code> is not evaluated at all, but when <code>condition</code> is false only <code>b</code> is evaluated and <code>a</code> is not evaluated at all.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'true' if True else 'false'
'true'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'true' if False else 'false'
'false'
</code></pre>
<p>Note that conditionals are an <em>expression</em>, not a <em>statement</em>. This means you can't use <strong>statements</strong> such as <code>pass</code>, or assignments with <code>=</code> (or &quot;augmented&quot; assignments like <code>+=</code>), within a conditional <strong>expression</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pass if False else pass
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    pass if False else pass
         ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

&gt;&gt;&gt; # Python parses this as `x = (1 if False else y) = 2`
&gt;&gt;&gt; # The `(1 if False else x)` part is actually valid, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; # it can't be on the left-hand side of `=`.
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1 if False else y = 2
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
SyntaxError: cannot assign to conditional expression

&gt;&gt;&gt; # If we parenthesize it instead...
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x = 1) if False else (y = 2)
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    (x = 1) if False else (y = 2)
       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>(In 3.8 and above, the <code>:=</code> &quot;walrus&quot; operator allows simple assignment of values <em>as an expression</em>, which is then compatible with this syntax. But please don't write code like that; it will quickly become very difficult to understand.)</p>
<p>Similarly, because it is an expression, the <code>else</code> part is <em>mandatory</em>:</p>
<pre><code># Invalid syntax: we didn't specify what the value should be if the 
# condition isn't met. It doesn't matter if we can verify that
# ahead of time.
a if True
</code></pre>
<p>You can, however, use conditional expressions to assign a variable like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x = a if True else b
</code></pre>
<p>Or for example to return a value:</p>
<pre><code># Of course we should just use the standard library `max`;
# this is just for demonstration purposes.
def my_max(a, b):
    return a if a &gt; b else b
</code></pre>
<p>Think of the conditional expression as switching between two values. We can use it when we are in a 'one value or another' situation, where we will <em>do the same thing</em> with the result, regardless of whether the condition is met. We use the expression to compute the value, and then do something with it. If you need to <em>do something different</em> depending on the condition, then use a normal <code>if</code> <strong>statement</strong> instead.</p>
<hr />
<p>Keep in mind that it's frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of the arguments is different from those of the classic <code>condition ? a : b</code> ternary operator from many other languages (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" rel="noreferrer">C++</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Go</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" rel="noreferrer">Perl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Java</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript</a>, etc.), which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with Python's &quot;surprising&quot; behaviour use it (they may reverse the argument order).</li>
<li>Some find it &quot;unwieldy&quot;, since it goes contrary to the normal flow of thought (thinking of the condition first and then the effects).</li>
<li>Stylistic reasons. (Although the 'inline <code>if</code>' can be <em>really</em> useful, and make your script more concise, it really does complicate your code)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're having trouble remembering the order, then remember that when read aloud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, <code>x = 4 if b &gt; 8 else 9</code> is read aloud as <code>x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9</code>.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 171 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>An operator for a conditional expression in Python was added in 2006 as part of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Enhancement Proposal 308</a>. Its form differs from common <code>?:</code> operator and it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;expression1&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>if &lt;condition&gt;: &lt;expression1&gt; else: &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>result = x if a &gt; b else y
</code></pre>
<p>Another syntax which can be used (compatible with versions before 2.5):</p>
<pre><code>result = (lambda:y, lambda:x)[a &gt; b]()
</code></pre>
<p>where operands are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lazily evaluated</a>.</p>
<p>Another way is by indexing a tuple (which isn't consistent with the conditional operator of most other languages):</p>
<pre><code>result = (y, x)[a &gt; b]
</code></pre>
<p>or explicitly constructed dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>result = {True: x, False: y}[a &gt; b]
</code></pre>
<p>Another (less reliable), but simpler method is to use <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators:</p>
<pre><code>result = (a &gt; b) and x or y
</code></pre>
<p>however this won't work if <code>x</code> would be <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>A possible workaround is to make <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> lists or tuples as in the following:</p>
<pre><code>result = ((a &gt; b) and [x] or [y])[0]
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>result = ((a &gt; b) and (x,) or (y,))[0]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're working with dictionaries, instead of using a ternary conditional, you can take advantage of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>get(key, default)</code></a>, for example:</p>

<h1>Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/reference/grammar.html" rel="noreferrer">grammar file</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>test: or_test ['if' or_test 'else' test] | lambdef
</code></pre>
<p>The part of interest is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>or_test ['if' or_test 'else' test]
</code></pre>
<p>So, a ternary conditional operation is of the form:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 if expression2 else expression3
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression3</code> will be lazily evaluated (that is, evaluated only if <code>expression2</code> is false in a boolean context). And because of the recursive definition, you can chain them indefinitely (though it may considered bad style.)</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 if expression2 else expression3 if expression4 else expression5 # and so on
</code></pre>
<h3>A note on usage:</h3>
<p>Note that every <code>if</code> must be followed with an <code>else</code>. People learning list comprehensions and generator expressions may find this to be a difficult lesson to learn - the following will not work, as Python expects a third expression for an else:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[expression1 if expression2 for element in iterable]
#                          ^-- need an else here
</code></pre>
<p>which raises a <code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code>.
So the above is either an incomplete piece of logic (perhaps the user expects a no-op in the false condition) or what may be intended is to use <code>expression2</code> as a filter - notes that the following is legal Python:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>[expression1 for element in iterable if expression2]
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression2</code> works as a filter for the list comprehension, and is <em>not</em> a ternary conditional operator.</p>
<h3>Alternative syntax for a more narrow case:</h3>
<p>You may find it somewhat painful to write the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 if expression1 else expression2
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression1</code> will have to be evaluated twice with the above usage. It can limit redundancy if it is simply a local variable. However, a common and performant Pythonic idiom for this use-case is to use <code>or</code>'s shortcutting behavior:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>expression1 or expression2
</code></pre>
<p>which is equivalent in semantics. Note that some style-guides may limit this usage on the grounds of clarity - it does pack a lot of meaning into very little syntax.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 38 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>One of the alternatives to Python's <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-September/056846.html" rel="noreferrer">conditional expression</a></p>

</code></pre>
<p>is the following:</p>
<pre><code>{True: &quot;yes&quot;, False: &quot;no&quot;}[boolean]
</code></pre>
<p>which has the following nice extension:</p>
<pre><code>{True: &quot;yes&quot;, False: &quot;no&quot;, None: &quot;maybe&quot;}[boolean_or_none]
</code></pre>
<p>The shortest alternative remains</p>
<pre><code>(&quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;)[boolean]
</code></pre>
<p>which works because <code>issubclass(bool, int)</code>.</p>
<p>Careful, though: the alternative to</p>
<pre><code>yes() if boolean else no()
</code></pre>
<p>is <em>not</em></p>
<pre><code>(no(), yes())[boolean]  # bad: BOTH no() and yes() are called
</code></pre>
<p>but</p>
<pre><code>(no, yes)[boolean]()
</code></pre>
<p>This works fine as long as <code>no</code> and <code>yes</code> are to be called with exactly the same parameters. If they are not, like in</p>
<pre><code>yes(&quot;ok&quot;) if boolean else no()  # (1)
</code></pre>
<p>or in</p>
<pre><code>yes(&quot;ok&quot;) if boolean else no(&quot;sorry&quot;)  # (2)

<p>then a similar alternative either does not exist (1) or is hardly viable (2). (In rare cases, depending on the context, something like</p>
<pre><code>msg = (&quot;sorry&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;)[boolean]
(no, yes)[boolean](msg)
</code></pre>
<p>could make sense.)</p>

<p>In many cases <code>&lt;expression 1&gt;</code> is also used as Boolean evaluated <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code>. Then you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">short-circuit evaluation</a>.</p>

<p>PS: Of course, a short-circuit evaluation is not a ternary operator, but often the ternary is used in cases where the short circuit would be enough. It has a better readability and can be chained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]</p>

<h3>1- Simple Method to use ternary operator:</h3>
<pre><code># Program to demonstrate conditional operator
a, b = 10, 20
# Copy value of a in min if a &lt; b else copy b
min = a if a &lt; b else b
print(min)  # Output: 10

<pre><code># Python program to demonstrate ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20
# Use tuple for selecting an item
print( (b, a) [a &lt; b] )
# Use Dictionary for selecting an item
print({True: a, False: b} [a &lt; b])
# lambda is more efficient than above two methods
# because in lambda  we are assure that
# only one expression will be evaluated unlike in
# tuple and Dictionary
print((lambda: b, lambda: a)[a &lt; b]()) # in output you should see three 10

if a != b:

        print(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;)

<p>Note that conditionals are an <em>expression</em>, not a <em>statement</em>. This means you can't use assignment statements or <code>pass</code> or other <strong>statements</strong> within a conditional <strong>expression</strong></p>

<h3>Walrus operator in Python 3.8</h3>
<p>After the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions" rel="noreferrer">walrus operator</a> was introduced in Python 3.8, something changed.</p>
<pre><code>(a := 3) if True else (b := 5)
</code></pre>
<p>gives <code>a = 3</code> and <code>b is not defined</code>,</p>
<pre><code>(a := 3) if False else (b := 5)
</code></pre>
<p>gives <code>a is not defined</code> and <code>b = 5</code>, and</p>
<pre><code>c = (a := 3) if False else (b := 5)
</code></pre>
<p>gives <code>c = 5</code>, <code>a is not defined</code> and <code>b = 5</code>.</p>
<p>Even if this may be ugly, <strong>assignments</strong> can be done <strong>inside</strong> conditional expressions after Python 3.8. Anyway, it is still better to use normal <code>if</code> <strong>statement</strong> instead in this case.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 27 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>More a tip than an answer (I don't need to repeat the obvious for the hundredth time), but I sometimes use it as a one-liner shortcut in such constructs:</p>
<pre><code>if conditionX:
    print('yes')
else:
    print('nah')
</code></pre>
<p>, becomes:</p>
<pre><code>print('yes') if conditionX else print('nah')
</code></pre>
<p>Some (many :) may frown upon it as unpythonic (even, Ruby-ish :), but I personally find it more natural - i.e., how you'd express it normally, plus a bit more visually appealing in large blocks of code.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 27 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You can do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[condition] and [expression_1] or [expression_2];
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>print(number%2 and &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This would print &quot;odd&quot; if the number is odd or &quot;even&quot; if the number is even.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>The result:</strong> If condition is true, exp_1 is executed, else exp_2 is executed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> 0, None, False, emptylist, and emptyString evaluates as False.</p>
<p>And any data other than 0 evaluates to True.</p>
<h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
<p>If the condition [condition] becomes &quot;True&quot;, then expression_1 will be evaluated, but not expression_2.</p>
<p>If we &quot;and&quot; something with 0 (zero), the result will always to be false. So in the below statement,</p>
<pre><code>0 and exp
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <em>exp</em> won't be evaluated at all since &quot;and&quot; with 0 will always evaluate to zero and there is no need to evaluate the expression. This is how the compiler itself works, in all languages.</p>
<p>In</p>
<pre><code>1 or exp
</code></pre>
<p>the expression <em>exp</em> won't be evaluated at all since &quot;or&quot; with 1 will always be 1. So it won't bother to evaluate the expression exp since the result will be 1 anyway (compiler optimization methods).</p>
<p>But in case of</p>
<pre><code>True and exp1 or exp2
</code></pre>
<p>The second expression exp2 won't be evaluated since <code>True and exp1</code> would be True when exp1 isn't false.</p>
<p>Similarly in</p>
<pre><code>False and exp1 or exp2
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <em>exp1</em> won't be evaluated since False is equivalent to writing 0 and doing &quot;and&quot; with 0 would be 0 itself, but after exp1 since &quot;or&quot; is used, it will evaluate the expression exp2 after &quot;or&quot;.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note:-</strong> This kind of branching using &quot;or&quot; and &quot;and&quot; can only be used when the expression_1 doesn't have a Truth value of False (or 0 or None or emptylist [ ] or emptystring ' '.) since if expression_1 becomes False, then the expression_2 will be evaluated because of the presence &quot;or&quot; between exp_1 and exp_2.</p>
<p><strong>In case you still want to make it work for all the cases regardless of what exp_1 and exp_2 truth values are, do this:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[condition] and ([expression_1] or 1) or [expression_2];
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 16 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Many programming languages derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C</a> usually have the following syntax of the ternary conditional operator:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;condition&gt; ? &lt;expression1&gt; : &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At first, the Python's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" rel="nofollow noreferrer">benevolent dictator for life</a> (I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Guido van Rossum</a>, of course) rejected it (as non-Pythonic style), since it's quite hard to understand for people not used to C language. Also, the colon sign <strong><code>:</code></strong> already has many uses in Python. After <strong>PEP 308</strong> was approved, Python finally received its own shortcut conditional expression (what we use now):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;expression1&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, firstly it evaluates the condition. If it returns <code>True</code>, <strong>expression1</strong> will be evaluated to give the result, otherwise <strong>expression2</strong> will be evaluated. Due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lazy evaluation</a> mechanics – only one expression will be executed.</p>
<p>Here are some examples (conditions will be evaluated from left to right):</p>
<pre><code>pressure = 10
print('High' if pressure &lt; 20 else 'Critical')

# Result is 'High'
</code></pre>
<p>Ternary operators can be chained in series:</p>
<pre><code>pressure = 5
print('Normal' if pressure &lt; 10 else 'High' if pressure &lt; 20 else 'Critical')

# Result is 'Normal'
</code></pre>
<p>The following one is the same as previous one:</p>
<pre><code>pressure = 5

if pressure &lt; 20:
    if pressure &lt; 10:
        print('Normal')
    else:
        print('High')
else:
    print('Critical')

# Result is 'Normal'

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 12 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Other answers correctly talk about the Python ternary operator. I would like to complement by mentioning a scenario for which the ternary operator is often used, but for which there is a better idiom. This is the scenario of using a default value.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to use <code>option_value</code> with a default value if it is not set:</p>
<pre><code>run_algorithm(option_value if option_value is not None else 10)
</code></pre>
<p>or, if <code>option_value</code> is never set to a falsy value (<code>0</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, etc.), simply</p>
<pre><code>run_algorithm(option_value if option_value else 10)
</code></pre>
<p>However, in this case an ever better solution is simply to write</p>
<pre><code>run_algorithm(option_value or 10)
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 12 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The syntax for the ternary operator in Python is:</p>
<p><code>[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]</code></p>
<p>Using that syntax, here is how we would rewrite the code above using Python’s ternary operator:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>game_type = 'home'
shirt = 'white' if game_type == 'home' else 'green'

</code></pre>
<p>It's still pretty clear, but much shorter. Note that the expression could be any type of expression, including a function call, that returns a value that evaluates to True or False.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 10 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Python has a ternary form for assignments; however there may be even a shorter form that people should be aware of.</p>
<p>It's very common to need to assign to a variable one value or another depending on a condition.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; li1 = None
&gt;&gt;&gt; li2 = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; if li1:
...     a = li1
... else:
...     a = li2
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>^ This is the long form for doing such assignments.</p>
<p>Below is the ternary form. But this isn't the most succinct way - see the last example.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = li1 if li1 else li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With Python, you can simply use <code>or</code> for alternative assignments.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = li1 or li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The above works since <code>li1</code> is <code>None</code> and the interpreter treats that as False in logic expressions. The interpreter then moves on and evaluates the second expression, which is not <code>None</code> and it's not an empty list - so it gets assigned to <em>a</em>.</p>
<p>This also works with empty lists. For instance, if you want to assign <code>a</code> whichever list has items.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; li1 = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; li2 = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = li1 or li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Knowing this, you can simply such assignments whenever you encounter them. This also works with strings and other iterables. You could assign <code>a</code> whichever string isn't empty.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = ''
&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = 'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = s1 or s2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I always liked the C ternary syntax, but Python takes it a step further!</p>
<p>I understand that some may say this isn't a good stylistic choice, because it relies on mechanics that aren't immediately apparent to all developers. I personally disagree with that viewpoint. Python is a syntax-rich language with lots of idiomatic tricks that aren't immediately apparent to the dabbler. But the more you learn and understand the mechanics of the underlying system, the more you appreciate it.</p>
