Where can I safely store items without worrying about them disappearing? </p>

<p>There are two possible places that come to mind, <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hod_and_Gerdur%27s_House">Gerdur's house</a> (to which I have the key and was told I could stay), and the small bedroom given to me at the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_of_Winterhold_%28place%29">College of Winterhold</a> (which I was told was mine, despite seeing J'zaro sitting in it later). Can I store items safely in either of these places?</p>
