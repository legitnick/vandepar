Where can I safely store items without worrying about them disappearing? </p>

<p>There are two possible places that come to mind, <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hod_and_Gerdur%27s_House">Gerdur's house</a> (to which I have the key and was told I could stay), and the small bedroom given to me at the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_of_Winterhold_%28place%29">College of Winterhold</a> (which I was told was mine, despite seeing J'zaro sitting in it later). Can I store items safely in either of these places?</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 45 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Places you can safely store your items include any houses you buy, your companion(s), and your horse.</p>

<p>Places considered to be owned by you (and therefore contain safe containers) are (spoiler warning):</p>

<blockquote class="spoiler">
  <p> <ul>
   <li>Arch-Mage Quarters (after you become Arch-Mage)</li>
   <li>The Dawnstar Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary (After you've finished the Dark Brotherhood quest line)</li>
 </ul></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have personally stored items in my apprentice quarters in the College of Winterhold without problems, however others have had stuff go missing from there, so be careful. </p>

<p>Other containers may not be safe. Given what some other answers have said, Gerder's house does not seem like a safe place for long-term storage.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 22 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The Skyrim manual states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WARNING! Do not leave things in containers you do not own! They may not be there when you come back for them. Buying a house is one way of owning containers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strike>I, and Doug, have also stored items in the room assigned to you at Winterhold College and it appears safe.</strike></p>

<p>EDIT: As stated in the comments below, the Winterhold College room is <strong>not</strong> safe. It just seemed safe to me at the time when the game was very new.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 21 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>From the UESP Wiki, "<a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim%3AContainers#Safe_Containers" rel="noreferrer">Containers - Safe Containers</a>":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Containers may be safe for one of two reasons. Some container types
  are set to be non-respawning — containers of that type will never
  respawn, no matter where the container is found. Other containers are
  safe because of their location — some locations, in particular the
  player's houses, are identified as non-respawning locations. All
  containers in these safe locations (even common Barrels and Sacks) can
  safely be used for storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ff. are safe containers for storage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Child's Chest - a part of child's bedroom [Hearthfire DLC]. It will be empty if you haven't adopted any children. Your children may collect various things and store them in their chest. Their older weapons, clothes and dolls will be kept in it too, if you give them a new one. Your children will restock it every few days. However, the original contents in it won't disappear.</li>
<li>Coffin - found in Halls of the Dead and Vampire Dungeons</li>
<li>Cupboard - common furniture in houses</li>
<li>Dresser</li>
<li>End Table - most frequently seen in houses</li>
<li>Pot</li>
<li>Riekling Hut [Dragonborn DLC]</li>
<li>Strongbox</li>
<li>Wardrobe</li>
</ul>

<p>From the UESP wiki's "<a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Containers#Safe_Containers" rel="noreferrer">Containers - Safe Locations</a>" article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Safe locations are places that never <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Respawn" rel="noreferrer">respawn</a>. Therefore, every
  container in the location (even a common barrel or sack) is safe for
  storage.  The primary example of a safe location is a player-owned
  <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Houses" rel="noreferrer">house</a>, but a large number of other places are also
  non-respawning. Unless noted otherwise on the place page, only the
  interior areas of these locations are safe — i.e., only regions that
  are entered through a door that triggers a loading screen, and have
  their own map, separate from the exterior map.</p>
  
  <p>In a few instances, there may be quest-related changes to the location
  (as noted on the individual place page), but otherwise the game does
  not modify the contents of a safe location.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following are safe locations for storage (from the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Skyrim-Places-Safe" rel="noreferrer">UESP Wiki</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are places that never <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Respawn" rel="noreferrer">respawn</a>, and therefore none of the
  containers automatically reset. Any quest-related changes to the
  location are noted on the place page. Note that individual <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Containers#Safe_Containers" rel="noreferrer">containers</a>
  in other locations may also be safe for storage.</p>

If you need additional space now, maybe try storing the items in your horse or companion, or try out those two locations you mentioned with something inexpensive. See if it disappears. </p>

<p>I dumped this armour I had that I couldn't be bothered selling just outside Blue Hall (The Solitude Jarl's house) and 10 hours of game play later it's still there.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 9 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I stored in the chest in that house for 29 hours and I just lost thousands in reserve gold and even more in items.</p>

<p>I would say buy a house and store there, and never put all your eggs in one basket</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The wardrobe in your bedroom in the College of Winterhold is definitely safe. I always use it and never had any kind of problem. Don't bother about J'zaro, he never takes your stuff. An interesting alternative is <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Anise%27s_Cabin" rel="noreferrer">Anise's Cabin</a>. You can safely store your items in the cupboard in the basement and it has an alchemy lab, an arcane enchanter and a bed. You may also be useful to take a look at this article about <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Containers" rel="noreferrer">containers</a> in Skyrim.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You remember getting the house key at the start of the game? Hob and Gerdur's house in Riverwood is your safe house until you actually purchase your own. I always store my stuff in the barrel beside the bed and nothing has ever gone missing.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 5 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>In addition to player-owned houses, there are some locations that do not respawn - and thus are safe for long-term storage.</p>

<p>One such location is the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Abandoned_House" rel="noreferrer">Abandoned House</a> in Markarth. This is an especially useful location as you do not need to purchase it (therefore you don't need to have a sum of gold on hand). To gain access to this location you only need to begin the <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_House_of_Horrors" rel="noreferrer">The House of Horrors</a> quest - you need not finish it.</p>

<p>This can all be done very early in the game (by taking a cart from Whiterun to Markarth), making it a great storage location.</p>

<p>To more specifically answer your question: Neither Gerdur's House nor the College of Winterhold are safe places. If you follow the links from your question, you'll see that they both have a respawn time of 10 days.</p>
