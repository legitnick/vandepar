<p>That seems unlikely.  It's a <em>lot</em> of work to make a game multiplayer, so I doubt they would go through all that effort for a feature they didn't expect anyone to ever actually use.</p>

<p>So, what happens when two players are on the same planet?  Can they see/interact/communicate with each other?</p>
