He wasn't cheap -- 1000g -- but he just doesn't seem that fast.  To make things worse, he's a bit of a wolf magnet and every time I get attacked I have to tediously dismount, blast the wolf, and then remount.</p>

<p>Is the speed of a horse actually significantly faster than normal running speed?  If so, how much faster?</p>
