This saves a lot of time and effort, because you do not have to revisit every dungeon you have been through like in <em>Oblivion</em>. Now I was wondering, how does the game determine if you have completed/finished/cleared the dungeon. I figured there are some options, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have killed every enemy.</li>
<li>You have obtained every 'important' treasure.</li>
<li>A combination of the above</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be even more options that I have not thought of. Can anyone shed some light on how the system works out if you have finished a dungeon?</p>

The game doesn't force you to loot stuff (e.g., Werewolf form can't loot) so it comes down to just killing; you don't have to do your quest.</p>

<p><strong>A victorious sound will play once you clear the dungeon, and the ambient sound will stop.</strong></p>

<p>If you don't kill all important inhabitants, <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/34964/do-dungeons-repopulate">inhabitants might respawn</a> and the dungeon will not be seen as cleared. Another occasion where inhabitants respawn in a dungeon is when you start a new quest that involves that dungeon; however, it won't change the cleared state of a dungeon.</p>

<p><strong>There are reports that some dungeons don't get cleared, or are cleared a different way.</strong> Some report that whatever they try to do, the dungeon doesn't get cleared; this might be because they still have a quest to do in the dungeon. Other report that a dungeon gets cleared after looting a chest or <strong>learning a new dragon shout word</strong>. Please note that not every dungeon has a word wall.</p>

<p>With the dungeon bounty given from Whiterun (Valtheim Towers), I went to the mountaintop adjacent to the keep, and from there was able to kill the chief bandit in that keep (I have mad archery skills). Once I did that, the dungeon showed as 'cleared' on my screen, and I was able to collect the bounty.</p>
<p>However, I didn't kill all the inhabitants. I killed 3 of them (there are six inhabitants to that keep, plus the outdoors guard on the road if you approach the keep from the road like you're supposed to).</p>
<p><strong>The dungeon is considered cleared once you kill the 'boss' for that dungeon, whether or not you kill all the inhabitants.</strong></p>
