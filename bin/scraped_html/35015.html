This saves a lot of time and effort, because you do not have to revisit every dungeon you have been through like in <em>Oblivion</em>. Now I was wondering, how does the game determine if you have completed/finished/cleared the dungeon. I figured there are some options, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have killed every enemy.</li>
<li>You have obtained every 'important' treasure.</li>
<li>A combination of the above</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be even more options that I have not thought of. Can anyone shed some light on how the system works out if you have finished a dungeon?</p>
