<li><p><code>git pull</code> tries to automatically merge after fetching commits. <em>It is context sensitive</em>, so all pulled commits will be merged into your currently active branch.  <code>git pull</code> automatically merges the commits <strong>without letting you review them first</strong>. If you don’t carefully manage your branches, you may run into frequent conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>git fetch</code> gathers any commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and <strong>stores them in your local repository</strong>. However, <strong>it does not merge them with your current branch</strong>. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your current branch, you must use <code>git merge</code> afterwards.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 1386 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>It is important to contrast the design philosophy of git with the philosophy of a more traditional source control tool like SVN.</p>

<p>Subversion was designed and built with a client/server model. There is a single repository that is the server, and several clients can fetch code from the server, work on it, then commit it back to the server. The assumption is that the client can always contact the server when it needs to perform an operation.</p>

<p>Git was designed to support a more distributed model with no need for a central repository (though you can certainly use one if you like). Also git was designed so that the client and the "server" don't need to be online at the same time. Git was designed so that people on an unreliable link could exchange code via email, even. It is possible to work completely disconnected and burn a CD to exchange code via git.</p>

<p>In order to support this model git maintains a local repository with your code and also an additional local repository that mirrors the state of the remote repository. By keeping a copy of the remote repository locally, git can figure out the changes needed even when the remote repository is not reachable.  Later when you need to send the changes to someone else, git can transfer them as a set of changes from a point in time known to the remote repository.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> is the command that says "bring my local copy of the remote repository up to date." </p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>git pull</code></strong> says "bring the changes in the remote repository to where I keep my own code."</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Normally <strong><code>git pull</code></strong> does this by doing a <strong><code>git fetch</code></strong> to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then merging the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy.</p>

<p>The take away is to keep in mind that there are often at least <strong>three copies</strong> of a project on your workstation. One copy is your own repository with your own commit history. The second copy is your working copy where you are editing and building. The third copy is your local "cached" copy of a remote repository.</p>

<p>When you clone a repository you fetch the entire repository to you local host. This means that at that time you have an origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code> and master pointing to the same <code>HEAD</code>.</p>

<p>when you start working and do commits you advance the master pointer to <code>HEAD</code> + your commits. But the origin/master pointer is still pointing to what it was when you cloned.</p>

<p>So the difference will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do a <code>git fetch</code> it will just fetch all the changes in the remote repository (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>) and move the origin/master pointer to <code>HEAD</code>. Meanwhile your local branch master will keep pointing to where it has.</li>
<li>If you do a <code>git pull</code>, it will do basically fetch (as explained previously) and merge any new changes to your master branch and move the pointer to <code>HEAD</code>.</li>

<p><code>git fetch</code> fetches updates but does not merge them.</p>
<p><code>git pull</code> does a <code>git fetch</code> under the hood and then a <code>merge</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Briefly</strong></p>
<p><code>git fetch</code> is similar to <code>pull</code> but doesn't merge. i.e. it fetches remote updates (<code>refs</code> and <code>objects</code>) but your local stays the same (i.e. <code>origin/master</code> gets updated but <code>master</code> stays the same) .</p>
<p><code>git pull</code> pulls down from a remote and instantly merges.</p>

<p><code>git clone</code> clones a repo.</p>
<p><code>git rebase</code> saves stuff from your current branch that isn't in the upstream branch to a temporary area. Your branch is now the same as before you started your changes. So, <code>git pull -rebase</code> will pull down the remote changes, rewind your local branch, replay your changes over the top of your current branch one by one until you're up-to-date.</p>

git-pull - Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch
SYNOPSIS

git pull   …
DESCRIPTION

Runs git-fetch with the given parameters, and calls git-merge to merge the 
retrieved head(s) into the current branch. With --rebase, calls git-rebase 
instead of git-merge.

Note that you can use . (current directory) as the &lt;repository> to pull 
from the local repository — this is useful when merging local branches 
into the current branch.

Also note that options meant for git-pull itself and underlying git-merge 
must be given before the options meant for git-fetch.
</pre>

<p>You would pull if you want the histories merged, you'd fetch if you just 'want the codez' as some person has been tagging some articles around here.</p>

<h2>git fetch</h2>
<p>It will download all <strong>refs</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> and any new branches to your local Repository...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, &quot;refs&quot;) from one or more
other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete their
histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description
of  below for ways to control this behavior).</p>
<p>By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is
also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring
remote..tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags explicitly,
you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you are interested
in as well.</p>
<p>git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL or
from several repositories at once if  is given and there is a
remotes. entry in the configuration file. (See git-config<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nWYnQ.png" rel="noreferrer">1</a>).</p>
<p>When no remote is specified, by default the origin remote will be
used, unless there’s an upstream branch configured for the current
branch.</p>
<p>The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names
they point at, are written to .git/FETCH_HEAD. This information may be
used by scripts or other git commands, such as git-pull.</p>

<h2>git pull</h2>
<p>It will apply the changes from <strong>remote</strong> to the <strong>current branch</strong> in local...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
In its default mode, git pull is shorthand for git fetch followed by
git merge FETCH_HEAD.</p>
<p>More precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and
calls git merge to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current
branch. With --rebase, it runs git rebase instead of git merge.</p>

the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with corresponding
remote-tracking branches (e.g., refs/heads/<em>:refs/remotes/origin/</em>),
but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository.</p>
<p>Default values for  and  are read from the
&quot;remote&quot; and &quot;merge&quot; configuration for the current branch as set by
git-branch --track.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 181 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The short and easy answer is that <code>git pull</code> is simply <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge</code>.</p>

<p>It is very important to note that <code>git pull</code> will <strong>automatically merge whether you like it or not</strong>. This could, of course, result in merge conflicts. Let's say your remote is <code>origin</code> and your branch is <code>master</code>. If you <code>git diff origin/master</code> before pulling, you should have some idea of potential merge conflicts and could prepare your local branch accordingly. </p>

<p>In addition to pulling and pushing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321185928/http://mettadore.com/2011/09/07/the-ever-deployable-github-workflow//" rel="noreferrer">some workflows</a> involve <code>git rebase</code>, such as this one, which I paraphrase from the linked article:</p>

<pre><code>git pull origin master
git checkout foo-branch
git rebase master
git push origin foo-branch
</code></pre>

<p>If you find yourself in such a situation, you may be tempted to <code>git pull --rebase</code>. Unless you really, really know what you are doing, I would advise against that. This warning is from the <code>man</code> page for <code>git-pull</code>, version <code>2.3.5</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a potentially dangerous mode of operation. It rewrites
  history, which does not bode well when you published that history
  already. Do not use this option unless you have read git-rebase(1)
  carefully.</p>

<p>Some major advantages for having a fetched mirror of the remote are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> (scroll through all commits and messages without trying to squeeze it through the network)</li>
<li><strong>Feedback</strong> about the state of your local repo (for example, I use Atlassian's SourceTree, which will give me a bulb indicating if I'm commits ahead or behind compared to the origin. This information can be updated with a GIT FETCH).</li>
</ul>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 126 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The Difference between <strong>GIT Fetch</strong> and <strong>GIT Pull</strong> can be explained with the following scenario:
<em>(Keeping in mind that pictures speak louder than words!, I have provided pictorial representation)</em></p>
<p>Let's take an example that you are working on a project with your team members. So there will be one main Branch of the project and all the contributors must fork it to their own local repository and then work on this local branch to modify/Add modules then push back to the main branch.</p>
<p>So,
<strong>Initial State</strong> of the two Branches when you forked the main project on your local repository will be like this- (<code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> are Modules already completed of the project)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPky3.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPky3.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>Now, you have started working on the new module (suppose <code>D</code>)  and when you have completed the <code>D</code> module you want to push it to the main branch, But meanwhile what happens is that one of your teammates has developed new Module <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> and modified <code>C</code>.<br>
So now what has happened is that your local repository is lacking behind the original progress of the project and thus pushing of your changes to the main branch can lead to conflict and may cause your Module <code>D</code> to malfunction.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SpIlX.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SpIlX.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>To avoid such issues and to work parallel with the original progress of the project there are Two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Git Fetch-</strong> This will Download all the changes that have been made to the origin/main branch project which are not present in your local branch. And will wait for the Git Merge command to apply the changes that have been fetched to your Repository or branch.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8qhgH.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8qhgH.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p>So now You can carefully monitor the files before merging it to your repository. And you can also modify <code>D</code> if required because of Modified <code>C</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JYA7S.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JYA7S.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Git Pull-</strong> This will update your local branch with the origin/main branch i.e. actually what it does is a combination of Git Fetch and Git merge one after another.
<em>But this may Cause Conflicts to occur, so it’s recommended to use Git Pull with a clean copy.</em></p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 112 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>In simple terms, if you were about to hop onto a plane without any Internet connection… before departing you could just do <code>git fetch origin &lt;branch&gt;</code>. It would fetch all the changes into your computer, but keep it separate from your local development/workspace.</p>
<p>On the plane, you could make changes to your local workspace and then merge it with what you've previously fetched and then resolve potential merge conflicts all without a connection to the Internet. And unless someone had made <em>new</em> changes to the remote repository then once you arrive at the destination you would do <code>git push origin &lt;branch&gt;</code> and go get your coffee.</p>
<hr />
<p>From this awesome <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch" rel="noreferrer">Atlassian tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
remote repository into your local repository.</p>
<p>Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody <em>else</em> has
been working on. It’s similar to SVN update in that it lets you see
how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to
actually merge the changes into your repository. Git <strong>isolates
fetched content as a from existing local content</strong>, it has absolutely
<strong>no effect on your local development work</strong>. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the <code>git checkout</code> command. This makes
fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with
your local repository.</p>
<p>When downloading content from a remote repository, <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code> commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider
<code>git fetch</code> the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download
the remote content, but not update your local repository's working state,
leaving your current work intact. <code>git pull</code> is the more aggressive
alternative, it will download the remote content for the active local
branch and immediately execute <code>git merge</code> to create a merge commit
for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress
this will cause conflicts and kickoff the merge conflict resolution
flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>With <code>git pull</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't get any isolation.</li>
<li>It doesn't need to be explicitly checked out. Because it implicitly does a <code>git merge</code>.</li>
<li>The merging step will affect your local development and <em>may</em> cause conflicts</li>
<li>It's basically NOT safe. It's aggressive.</li>
<li>Unlike <code>git fetch</code> where it only affects your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code>, git pull will affect both your <code>.git/refs/remotes</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>.git/refs/heads/</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Hmmm...so if I'm not updating the working copy with <code>git fetch</code>, then where am I making changes? Where does Git fetch store the new commits?</strong></p>
<p>Great question. First and foremost, the <code>heads</code> or <code>remotes</code> don't store the new commits. They just have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3965676/why-did-my-git-repo-enter-a-detached-head-state/65847406#65847406">pointers</a> to commits. So with <code>git fetch</code> you download the latest <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/git_object_types.html" rel="noreferrer">git objects</a> (blob, tree, commits. To fully understand the objects watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG90LZotrpo" rel="noreferrer">this video on git internals</a>), but only update your <code>remotes</code> pointer to point to the latest commit of that branch.  It's still isolated from your working copy, because your branch's pointer in the <code>heads</code> directory hasn't updated. It will only update upon a <code>merge</code>/<code>pull</code>. But again where? Let's find out.</p>
<p>In your project directory (i.e., where you do your <code>git</code> commands) do:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>ls</code>. This will show the files &amp; directories. Nothing cool, I know.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now do <code>ls -a</code>. This will show <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21778/whats-so-special-about-directories-whose-names-begin-with-a-dot">dot files</a>, i.e., files beginning with <code>.</code> You will then be able to see a directory named: <code>.git</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do <code>cd .git</code>. This will obviously change your directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now comes the fun part; do <code>ls</code>. You will see a list of directories. We're looking for <code>refs</code>. Do <code>cd refs</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's interesting to see what's inside all directories, but let's focus on two of them. <code>heads</code> and <code>remotes</code>. Use <code>cd</code> to check inside them too.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Any</em> <code>git fetch</code> that you do will update the pointer in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory. It <strong>won't</strong> update anything in the <code>/.git/refs/heads</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Any</em> <code>git pull</code> will first do the <code>git fetch</code> and update items in the <code>/.git/refs/remotes</code> directory.  It will then <strong>also</strong> merge with your local and then change the head inside the <code>/.git/refs/heads</code> directory.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, look for &quot;Slash notation&quot; from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200720025623/http://www.guyroutledge.co.uk:80/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/" rel="noreferrer">Git branch naming conventions</a> post. It helps you better understand how Git places things in different directories.</p>
<hr />
<h2>To see the actual difference</h2>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin master
git checkout master
</code></pre>
<p>If the remote master was updated you'll get a message like this:</p>
<pre><code>Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use &quot;git pull&quot; to update your local branch)
</code></pre>
<p>If you didn't <code>fetch</code> and just did <code>git checkout master</code> then your local git wouldn't know that there are 2 commits added. And it would just say:</p>
<pre><code>Already on 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
</code></pre>
<p>But that's outdated and incorrect. It's because git will give you feedback solely based on what it knows. It's oblivious to new commits that it hasn't pulled down yet...</p>
<hr />
<h2>Is there any way to see the new changes made in remote while working on the branch locally?</h2>
<p>Some IDEs (e.g. Xcode) are super smart and use the result of a <code>git fetch</code> and can annotate the lines of code that have been changed in remote branch of your current working branch. If that line has been changed by both local changes and remote branch, then that line gets annotated with red. This isn't a merge conflict. It's a <em>potential</em> merge conflict. It's a headsup that you can use to resolve the future merge conflict before doing <code>git pull</code> from the remote branch.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEl72.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEl72.png" alt="enter image description here" /></a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Fun tip:</h2>
<p>If you fetched a remote branch e.g. did:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch origin feature/123
</code></pre>
<p>Then this would go into your remotes directory. It's still not available to your local directory. However, it simplifies your checkout to that remote branch by DWIM (Do what I mean):</p>
<pre><code>git checkout feature/123
</code></pre>
<p>you no longer need to do:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b feature/123 origin/feature/123
</code></pre>

<pre><code>git pull == git fetch + git merge
</code></pre>

<p>If you run <code>git pull</code>, you do not need to merge the data to local. If you run <code>git fetch</code>, it means you must run <code>git merge</code> for getting the latest code to your local machine. Otherwise, the local machine code would not be changed without merge. </p>

<p>So in the Git Gui, when you do fetch, you have to merge the data. Fetch itself won't make the code changes at your local. You can check that when you update the code by fetching
once fetch and see; the code it won't change. Then you merge... You will see the changed code.</p>

<p><strong>Git Merge</strong></p>

<p>You can apply changes downloaded through fetch using the merge command. Merge will take the commits retrieved from fetch and try to add them to your local branch.

  <p>What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand this, you first need to understand that your local git maintains not only your local repository, but it also maintains a local copy of the remote repository.</p>

<p><code>git fetch</code> brings your local copy of the remote repository up to date. For example, if your remote repository is GitHub - you may want to fetch any changes made in the remote repository to your local copy of it the remote repository. This will allow you to perform operations such as compare or merge.</p>

<p><code>git pull</code> on the other hand will bring down the changes in the remote repository to where you keep your own code. Typically, <code>git pull</code> will do a <code>git fetch</code> first to bring the local copy of the remote repository up to date, and then it will merge the changes into your own code repository and possibly your working copy. </p>
