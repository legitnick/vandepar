<p>See the documentation:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms535920%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="noreferrer">abort Method</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Developer_Network" rel="noreferrer">MSDN</a>). Cancels the current HTTP request.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/abort" rel="noreferrer">abort()</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Developer_Network" rel="noreferrer">MDN</a>). If the request has been sent already, this method will abort the request.</li>
</ul>



<pre><code>var xhr = $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "some.php",
    data: "name=John&amp;location=Boston",
    success: function(msg){
       alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );
    }
});

//kill the request
xhr.abort()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
As of jQuery 1.5 the returned object is a wrapper for the native XMLHttpRequest object called jqXHR. This object appears to expose all of the native properties and methods so the above example still works. See <em><a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR" rel="noreferrer">The jqXHR Object</a></em> (jQuery API documentation).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong>
As of jQuery 3, the ajax method now returns a promise with extra methods (like abort), so the above code still works, though the object being returned is not an <code>xhr</code> any more. See the <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/14/jquery-3-0-beta-released/" rel="noreferrer">3.0 blog here</a>. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 3</strong>: <code>xhr.abort()</code> still works on jQuery 3.x. Don't assume the <em>update 2</em> is correct. <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2084#issuecomment-308173243" rel="noreferrer">More info on jQuery Github repository</a>.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 123 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>You can't recall the request but you can set a timeout value after which the response will be ignored.  See this <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Ajax/jQuery.ajax#options" rel="noreferrer">page</a> for jquery AJAX options.  I believe that your error callback will be called if the timeout period is exceeded.  There is already a default timeout on every AJAX request.</p>

<p>You can also use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest#abort%28%29" rel="noreferrer">abort()</a> method on the request object but, while it will cause the client to stop listening for the event, it <strike>may</strike> probably will not stop the server from processing it.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 80 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Save the calls you make in an array, then call <code>xhr.abort()</code> on each.</p>
<p><strong>HUGE CAVEAT</strong>: You can abort a request, but that's only the client side. The server side could still be processing the request. If you are using something like PHP or ASP with session data, the session data is locked until the ajax has finished. So, to allow the user to continue browsing the website, you have to call <strong><code>session_write_close()</code></strong>. This saves the session and unlocks it so that other pages waiting to continue will proceed. Without this, several pages can be waiting for the lock to be removed.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 78 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>It's an <strong><code>asynchronous</code></strong> request, meaning once it's sent it's out there.</p>
<p>In case your server is starting a very expensive operation due to the <code>AJAX</code> request, the best you can do is open your server to listen for cancel requests, and send a separate <code>AJAX</code> request notifying the server to stop whatever it's doing.</p>
<p>Otherwise, simply ignore the <code>AJAX</code> response.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 69 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>AJAX requests may not complete in the order they were started. Instead of aborting, you can choose to <em>ignore</em> all AJAX responses except for the most recent one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a counter</li>
<li>Increment the counter when you initiate AJAX request</li>
<li>Use the current value of counter to "stamp" the request</li>
<li>In the success callback compare the stamp with the counter to check if it was the most recent request</li>
</ul>

<p>Rough outline of code:</p>

<pre><code>var xhrCount = 0;
function sendXHR() {
    // sequence number for the current invocation of function
    var seqNumber = ++xhrCount;
    $.post("/echo/json/", { delay: Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) }, function() {
        // this works because of the way closures work
        if (seqNumber === xhrCount) {
            console.log("Process the response");
        } else {
            console.log("Ignore the response");
        }
    });
}
sendXHR();
sendXHR();
sendXHR();
// AJAX requests complete in any order but only the last 
// one will trigger "Process the response" message
</code></pre>
