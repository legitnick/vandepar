</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 218 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Popular belief among those of us who remember the original NES held that that blowing into an NES cartridge removed dust from the contacts, which allowed a better connection to the system.  In practice, the method was similar to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plug in cartridge, turn on system</li>
<li>Curse when system does not work</li>
<li>Pull out cartridge, blow</li>
<li>Re-seat cartridge, try system again</li>
</ul>

<p>In a few cases, blowing may have actually removed dust, but the truth is that <strong>most of the time, what actually fixed the problem was the act of pulling the cartridge out and putting it back in.</strong></p>

<p>As the original NES required you to put the cartridge in and then down, another common trick was to shove a second cartridge in the slot on top of the first one, which prevented the bottom (game) cartridge from slipping.</p>

When the system didn't work, most people's natural assumption was that the connectors were dirty. The most logical way to clean something like cartridge connectors was to blow on it. They also sold cleaning kits, but in my experience they weren't actually that helpful.</p>

<p>The problem wasn't the cartridges, but the connectors in the NES itself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System#Hardware_design_flaws" rel="noreferrer">According to Wikipedia</a>, the problem is due to Nintendo's use of a "zero-insertion force" cartridge connector:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a user inserted the cartridge
  into the NES, the force of pressing
  the cartridge down and into place bent
  the contact pins slightly, as well as
  pressing the cartridge’s ROM board
  back into the cartridge itself.
  Repeated insertion and removal of
  cartridges caused the pins to wear out
  relatively quickly and the ZIF design
  proved far more prone to interference
  by dirt and dust than an
  industry-standard card edge connector.
  Exacerbating the problem was
  Nintendo’s choice of materials; the
  slot connector that the cartridge was
  actually inserted into was highly
  prone to corrosion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further, Nintendo used the "10NES" lockout chip, which required constant communication with the cartridge to authenticate it as a legal cartridge. When it didn't have the communication, the result was "the blinking red power light, in which the system appears to turn itself on and off repeatedly because the 10NES would reset the console once per second. ... Alternatively, the console would turn on but only show a solid white, gray, or green screen."</p>

This was quite contrary to my strategies as a young kid. I was applauded for determining the "trick"; it seems my methods are more methodical these days.</p>

<p>So perhaps it was the reinsertion that did it and not blowing, specifically: inserting it less.
I'd be interested to know how many other NES consoles had this idiosyncrasy.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>NES cartridges physically attached to the console - similar to USB drive. If dust got in the cartridge, it could get between the contacts on the cartridge and contacts on the console, preventing a good electrical connection.</p>

<p>Blowing into the cartridge can shift the dust away from the contacts, making a non-working cartridge functional again.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Not only did word spread around, but a lot of media outlets showed kids blowing on the cartridge to make it work.  Nintendo Power in particular would recommend it, as well as the official Nintendo Cleaning Kit, and it was well-known that dust was problematic.  </p>

<p>Like every other answer here though, I have to point out that re-inserting the cartridge was what really did the trick.  </p>

<p>I admit that I also blew into the console <em>itself</em> because of this voodoo, because if dust could get into the cartridge, why not the system?  It was about as effective as cartridge-blowing. </p>

Beyond blowing out the dust there seemed to be some connection with moisture.  If I blew it out and then breathed on it to make it damp it seemed to work better. </p>

<p>The question about how everyone knew to do it?  I agree with the instinct theory.  My brother and I worked out this system by ourselves.  You look at it, and for some reason the first thing you think of is either to stick your finger in it or to blow in it, LOL.</p>
