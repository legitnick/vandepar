<p>You can now discard unstaged changes in <strong>one tracked file</strong> with:</p>
<pre><code>git restore &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and in <strong>all tracked files</strong> in the current directory (recursively) with:</p>
<pre><code>git restore .
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the latter from the root of the repository, it will discard unstaged changes in all tracked files in the project.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>git restore</code> was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/f496b064fc1135e0dded7f93d85d72eb0b302c22" rel="noreferrer">July 2019</a> and released in version 2.23 as part of a split of the <code>git checkout</code> command into <code>git restore</code> for files and <code>git switch</code> for branches.</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> still behaves as it used to and the older answers remain perfectly valid.</li>
<li>When running <code>git status</code> with unstaged changes in the working tree, this is now what Git suggests to use to discard them (instead of <code>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;</code> as it used to prior to v2.23).</li>
<li>As with <code>git checkout -- .</code>, this only discards changes in tracked files. So <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12184274/9210961">Mariusz Nowak's answer</a> still applies and if you want to discard all unstaged changes, including untracked files, you could run, as he suggests, an additional <code>git clean -df</code>.</li>

</code></pre>
<p>This is the online help text for the used <code>git clean</code> options:</p>
<p><code>-d</code></p>
<p>Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is not removed by default. Use <code>-f</code> option twice if you really want to remove such a directory.</p>
<p><code>-x</code></p>
<p>Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from <code>.gitignore</code> (per directory) and <code>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</code>, but do still use the ignore rules given with <code>-e</code> options. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with <code>git reset</code>) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build.</p>
<p><code>-n</code></p>
<p>Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.</p>
<p><code>-f</code></p>
<p>If the Git configuration variable <code>clean.requireForce</code> is not set to <code>false</code>, Git clean will refuse to delete files or directories unless given <code>-f</code>, <code>-n</code>, or <code>-i</code>. Git will refuse to delete directories within the <code>.git</code> subdirectory or file, unless a second <code>-f</code> is given.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout" rel="noreferrer">https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout</a> </p>

<p>In git command, stashing of untracked files is achieved by using:</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 66 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I really found this article helpful for explaining when to use what command: <a href="http://www.szakmeister.net/blog/2011/oct/12/reverting-changes-git/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.szakmeister.net/blog/2011/oct/12/reverting-changes-git/</a></p>

<p>There are a couple different cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you haven't staged the file, then you use <code>git checkout</code>.  Checkout "updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index".  If the files have not been staged (aka added to the index)... this command will essentially revert the files to what your last commit was.  </p>

<p><code>git checkout -- foo.txt</code></p></li>
<li><p>If you have staged the file, then use git reset.  Reset changes the index to match a commit.</p>

<p><code>git reset -- foo.txt</code> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that using <code>git stash</code> is a popular choice since it's a little less dangerous.  You can always go back to it if you accidently blow too much away when using git reset.  Reset is recursive by default.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you want to keep files not yet tracked, but not in GITIGNORE you may wish to skip this step, as it will Wipe these untracked files not found on your remote repository (thanks @XtrmJosh).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Description</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that
  are not under version control, starting from the current directory.</p>
  
  <p>Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the -x option
  is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example,
  be useful to remove all build products.</p>
  
  <p>If any optional ... arguments are given, only those paths are
  affected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Options</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-d Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is
  not removed by default. Use -f option twice if you really want to
  remove such a directory.</p>
  
  <p>-f
  --force If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to false, git clean will refuse to run unless given -f, -n or -i.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem, perhaps not identical, and I'm sad to say my solution is not ideal, but it is ultimately effective.</p>

<p>I would often have git status messages like this (involving at least 2/4 files):</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
# Not currently on any branch.
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#

#       modified:   doc/PROJECT/MEDIUM/ATS-constraint/parsing/parsing_s2Var.dats
</code></pre>

<p>A keen eye will note that these files have dopplegangers that are a single letter in case off. Somehow, and I have no idea what led me down this path to start with (as I was not working with these files myself from the upstream repo), I had switched these files. Try the many solutions listed on this page (and other pages) did not seem to help. </p>

<p><strong>I was able to fix the problem by deleting my forked repository and all local repositories, and reforking. This alone was not enough; upstream had to rename the files in question to new filenames.</strong> As long as you don't have any uncommited work, no wikis, and no issues that diverge from the upstream repository, you should be just fine. Upstream may not be very happy with you, to say the least. As for my problem, it is undoubtedly a user error as I'm not that proficient with git, but the fact that it is far from easy to fix points to an issue with git as well. </p>

<p>If the good stuff is committed in a single commit, then you can use "amend last commit" to bring it back to being staged or unstaged if you'd ultimately  like to commit it a little differently.</p>

<p>This might not be the technical solution you are looking for to your problem, but I find it a very practical solution. It allows you to discard unstaged changes selectively, resetting the changes you don't like and keeping the ones you do.</p>
