So far I've just been digging around just above bedrock on a whim to look for these rare minerals but I've started thinking that I should be taking a more controlled, efficient approach to mining.</p>

<p><strong>What is the optimal mining strategy that yields the most rare minerals while minimizing blocks removed and time spent digging and traveling?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The existing answers are great for mining, but no one has addressed travel time to and from the mine which is usually ~60 blocks downward and incredibly tedious. Solutions?</p>

<p><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Mining#Branch_Mining" rel="noreferrer">Branch mining</a> is the most efficient.  There's a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131208061328/http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/Elites_of_Minecraft:_The_Miner" rel="noreferrer">mathematical analysis</a></strong> on it in the official forums (the link is to an archive of the post).</p>
<p>Here's a brief description of branch mining:</p>
<ul>
<li>You dig down to the bedrock, because that's where you're going to find the most different kinds of stuff.</li>
<li>One or two layers above the bedrock, so you don't have it interfering with your work, you dig a long tunnel, 2 high and 1 wide, which will serve as the trunk.</li>
<li>Then, every 4 squares on either side of the trunk, you dig perpendicular tunnels extending out 20 blocks (or as far as you want).</li>
<li>You leave 3 undug blocks between because veins are generally 2x2 horizontally, so you will see ore in the vein even though there is technically one row of unexplored blocks.</li>
<li>When you finish that layer, you can start one a layer above, offsetting the branches by one block so that you are more likely to find veins you could possibly have missed the first time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So essentially, a long hallway (the trunk) with perpendicular hallways (the branches) coming off either side.</p>
<pre><code>██▒▒▒▒▒▒  ██ blocks you should mine
██▒▒▒▒▒▒  ▒▒ blocks you can see
▒▒▒▒██▒▒  __ blocks you can't see if you don't mine ▒▒ blocks (there's none!)
▒▒▒▒██▒▒  Repeat this pattern as many times as needed
</code></pre>
<p>From a head on view</p>
<h1>Travel</h1>
<p>As with any mine, travel is most easily accomplished using minecarts.</p>
<p>You can place a <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPls6LXlkGI" rel="noreferrer">booster</a></strong> to get your cart traveling at max speed in a short distance so that you can make the trip up quickly, and you can even attach chests to mine carts to carry all your findings from the mine up the track very quickly.</p>
<p>Short of minecarts, make sure you're using stairs and ladders to their fullest potential.  You don't want to be jumping up one block at a time all the way from your mine to your base.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 107 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131208061328/http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/Elites_of_Minecraft:_The_Miner" rel="noreferrer">great wiki</a> with some number crunching.</p>

<p>I use this in single player:</p>

<pre><code>▒▒██▒▒__▒▒__   ██ blocks you should mine
▒▒██▒▒__▒▒__   ▒▒ blocks you can see
__▒▒__▒▒██▒▒   __ blocks you can't see if you don't mine ▒▒ blocks
__▒▒__▒▒██▒▒   Repeat this pattern as many times as needed
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, I have a 2x1 trunk, and branches like a standard branch mine, but instead of just going outwards from the trunk, I go up one level and out, skip two blocks, then down one level and out.  I leave two blocks between branches.  And I leave two blocks between floors, and line up the branches the same between floors.</p>

<p>There are some areas left unexplored by this pattern, but they are thin, and it is unlikely that a diamond vein with spawn entirely within that narrow region. (About 3% will).  The larger number of blocks uncovered are far more likely to contain diamonds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your high density branch mine gets you 100% diamonds, the low density branch mine would give you <strong>212.6%</strong> ores in the same time, minus 3% from the earlier probability worked out before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, you ought to build it so that the floor of the lowest tunnel is on level 11, to avoid falling in lava.  If you find that there are few cave systems near your mine, feel free to dig lower, but caves tend to cluster, and caves level 10 and below are filled with lava.</p>

<p>I dig my main tunnel on both sides of the area I want to cover, then dig back and forth in a zigzag patten, which means I'm always digging, never walking.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is true anymore, but it used to be that larger deposits were formed by the word generator in multiplayer, so you were less likely to miss diamond deposits when using a wider mining pattern. Thus, this pattern</p>

<pre><code>▒▒██▒▒____▒▒____  ██ blocks you should mine
▒▒██▒▒____▒▒____  ▒▒ blocks you can see
__▒▒____▒▒██▒▒__  __ blocks you can't see if you don't mine ▒▒ blocks
__▒▒____▒▒██▒▒__     Repeat this pattern as many times as needed
</code></pre>

<p>is more efficient.</p>

<p>As for transit?  I use a long two wide straight staircase that goes all the way to bedrock.  Minecarts work well for getting me deep into the mine.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 77 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>If you're not married to building a completely man-made mine, the answer is to find a deep tunnel.</p>

<p>Getting down to the bottom is correct, as that is where the highest concentration of useful minerals is located, but digging a tunnel doesn't expose you to nearly the same amount of blocks as using a generated cave system.</p>

<p>In my primary game, I dug a mine down to the bottom, clearing out a large amount of stone, which only resulted in some coal, and very few iron, where as at the bottom I discovered a cave network (filled with lava, but some water solved that), which resulted in a large amount of coal and iron, as well as diamond and gold.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 67 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Just dig 2 high in one direction for a very long time, say around an hour... it's not like you'll run out of map.</p>

<p>Then move 3 or four along once you've used half of your axe/s, and go back to where you started.</p>

<p>This will yield more in terms of ore versus time, as you are not mucking around walking between shafts and veins, and are spending almost all the time mining. Bring with you a diamond pick axe, and a shovel, since dirt and gravel still spawn underground. Use the cobblestone you will inevitably mine for traversing lava pools, and make sure you have torches (place them every 10 or so blocks).</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 58 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>In regards to getting to and from your mine:</p>

<p>My solution is to never leave the mine. Bring down some saplings, some wheat seeds, and whatever else, and build your base underground near your mine. It's a lot safer and more predictable than living on the surface, since you can completely light your cave system.</p>

<p>The only downside is that eventually your character turns pale and starts muttering about "My precious..."</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 49 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>All of the previous answers focus on minimizing blocks mined.  However, if you're interested in minimizing time, there is a vastly faster late game strategy than anything discussed above.</p>

<p>The approach, is to use a Diamond pickax, enchanted with Level 5 efficiency, and a Haste level II Beacon.  With this setup, you mine stone instantaneously and can clear cut vast swaths of stone in very little time, exposing significantly more blocks / minute than with branch mining.</p>

It was a vicious circle. I've started mining with TNT now and it's much faster. Here's how I do it:</p>

<p>I use the branch mining technique. For a branch off the trunk I'll use 64 TNT and 32 torches. I'll dig a 2-high tunnel off the trunk, placing a torch every 10 blocks in. When I run out of torches I know I'm 320 blocks away from the trunk. </p>

<p>Now I'll place a block of cobblestone on the ground at the very end with a block of TNT on top. Then I back up while placing cobblestone on the ground only, putting a block of TNT on top of every 5th cobblestone block so there are 4 empty spaces between TNT blocks. </p>

<p>When I get back to the trunk I set off the TNT and then run along behind the blast placing torches on the wall as I go. When I get to the end I walk back to the trunk mining whatever I see along the way and picking up anything on the ground. </p>

<p>Each trunk takes me about 30 minutes to dig, blast and mine. I use only a fraction of a diamond pickaxe in the process. I've been mining 12-13 levels up from the bottom and getting 15-20 diamonds per trunk. The most tedious part is collecting the sand to make the TNT. I have a mob trap that I use to collect the gunpowder at night.</p>

<p>Give it a shot and see what you think, it's working well for me. I have mine cart tack with periodic boosters running along my trunk line to get me back and forth to my storage area quickly.</p>

<p>The straight down to bedrock approach I find is really good for redstone but not much else.  I find that in the generated caves there is a lot more ore along the walls.  So you really need both I think.</p>

I now have about 15-20 BLOCKS of diamond 20-23 BLOCKS of gold  like 30-50 stacks of coal no red (I don't mine it just go around) and 40-45 BLOCKS of iron all totaling about 7 hrs of work</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 22 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>This a well covered question already but the technique I personally use isn't listed so I figure I'll add it to the mix.  It isn't the technique for strip mining a chunk and extracting absolutely <strong>everything</strong> but it <strong>does</strong> expose lots of extra unseen blocks.  </p>

<p>It is much faster for quickly gaining things you want, it's incredibly easy to do, and is also less wearing on your pickaxes. </p>

<p><strong><em>Getting down to and up from the mine:</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Use water held up by a sign at the bottom of a 1x1 shaft that is straight down starting up at the surface for dropping to diamond ore levels.<br>
To make it, dig a 1x3 section (so you don't mine beneath your feet) leave one side open for the drop shaft, fill the middle with cobble, and place ladders in the other shaft.  </p>

<p>The drop can be as great a distance as you want as long as the bottom of it looks like this:    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>o = Stone<br>
     <strong>X</strong> = Dug out<br>
     <strong>W</strong> = Water<br>
     <strong>S</strong> = A Wood Sign<br>
     <strong>L</strong> = Ladder</p>
  
  <p>o <strong>X</strong> o <strong>L</strong> o<br>
   o <strong>X</strong> o <strong>L</strong> o<br>
   o <strong>X</strong> o <strong>L</strong> o<br>
   o <strong>W</strong> o <strong>L</strong> o<br>
  o <strong>S</strong> o <strong>L</strong> o<br>
  <strong>X X X L X</strong> ( This is the mine )<br>
  <strong>X X X L X</strong>   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The drop is quick and completely safe. I use ladders for the return trip up but, if you prefer, (I think they take too long to make and are unreliable) you can make boat-waterfall ladder for coming back up.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Mining:</em></strong>  </p>

<p>1: Dig the standard 2x1 tunnels away from your entry point. I personally do this standing at Y: 9 so I occasionally run into unexplored caves but, if you are scared of cave mining, do it at Y:8 or Y:7.  I don't suggest going to a lower depth than this because bedrock can get in the way, and ore veins that are beneath your feet will be smaller.</p>

<p>2: Every 4th block into your tunnel dig the upper blocks in a 1x1 shaft as far as you can reach on both sides of your tunnel.  If you see an ore you like, dig the bottom out and go get it! </p>

<p>The view of walls of your 2x1 tunnel would look like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>x</strong> = dug out<br>
  o = stone<br>
   o o o <strong>x</strong> o o o <strong>x</strong> o o o <strong>x</strong> o o o <strong>x</strong> o o o <strong>x</strong> o o o <strong>x</strong> o o<br>
   o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Extra optional step:  </p>

<p>3: If you want to squeeze more out of this type of mine, return once you have finished a good section and bring pieces of TnT. Place them in the back of the 1x1 shafts in the sides of your mine and set them off with Flint n Steel.  I don't always do this because making TnT is a pain... but it does work.</p>

<p><strong>General Mining Tips:</strong></p>

<p>1: When mining always place torches on the right wall.  When you want to come back just turn around and follow the torches that are now on your left.  This is a very helpful technique for not getting lost in any mine exploring or digging.</p>

<p>2: If you have a well enchanted diamond shovel, dig out the sections of dirt  you come across.  High level shovels obliterate dirt at an insane speed and this typically reveals interesting stuff.  </p>

<p>Hope this helps! </p>

<p>Dig a shaft straight down, with water a block or two deep on the bottom, for fast downwards travel.</p>

<p>Build a Nether portal on the surface, transfer to Nether to spawn a matching portal there. Jump down your drop shaft, then build another portal on the bottom - it will be close enough that it should link to the same Nether portal as the surface one (but the spawning algorithm should have placed the Nether portal closer to optimal coordinates for the  surface one so it will be still preferred when traveling from Nether), so you will only need to exit and reenter the same portal in Nether and you'll be transported from the bottom to the surface portal.</p>

<p>For horizontal travel underground still nothing beats railway - if you plan to use horses, you will have to make rather big corridors.</p>

<p>The advantages are definitely cost and simplicity of both solutions (note: you can cast the portals with lava buckets instead of digging obsidian, if you don't want to make a diamond rock pick) and speed - both solutions are faster than most of alternatives offered by others.</p>

<p>The disadvantage is Nether portals are somewhat fickle. Your portal might link to the bottom portal instead of the top one, if the corresponding Nether space happens to be an extremely tall chamber. If you have any other Nether portals within several chunks, chances are you'll get linked to their corresponding Nether exits instead. It's nothing you can't overcome with a calculator, a stack of Netherrack and 10 blocks of obsidian (sorry, can't cast lava into Obsidian in Nether) to place a portal at the correct point in Nether manually, but with a little bad luck the trivial task becomes a rather daunting one, if the "correct point" happens to be an air block far above an enormous lake of lava. Nevertheless, always build a housing around the Nether portal so that a stray Ghast fireball doesn't extinguish it.</p>

<p>There have been quite a few possible improvements to mining since most of the other answers were posted.</p>
<p>First of all, transportation from the top to the bottom: water elevators.
With update 1.13, water mechanics were improved, including a easy way of setting up super fast water elevators.</p>
<p>All you need on the way down is the old school method: water at the very bottom prevents any damage from a long fall.</p>
<p>On the way up, however, you can put Soul sand under a water elevator, which gets you to the top in a matter of seconds, and as a bonus prevents any drowning because Soul sand produces bubbles, as shown on the image:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhdRu.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhdRu.png" alt="Soul sand." /></a></p>
<p>Next, you can fit into a space that is <strong>one block high!</strong> There's two methods of getting this working.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using an Elytra to fly into the small space by flying into the one block. Here's the setup:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PP5Sw.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PP5Sw.png" alt="One block." /></a></p>
<p>It may seem like you will have a hard time mining with your head in stone, but you do not take any suffocation damage and the point of view looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ww2kM.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ww2kM.png" alt="POV." /></a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Swimming into the hole. This method is very similar to the Elytra method. You place some water, start swimming in it and swim into the 1x1x1 gap. It is easier to set up than getting an Elytra, but it requires having to carry a bucket of water at all times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, as of version 1.14, both these methods were massively downgraded, as there is a huge movement speed penalty (maximum speed is about the same as when sneaking), because the player remains in the flying/swimming position:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/10dPD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/10dPD.png" alt="Howdy." /></a></p>
<p>Even after the downgrade, the blocks revealed over time ratio is still slightly higher than digging a 2x1 corridor, and you don't have your head stuck in the block above anymore.</p>
<p>The final tip I have is <strong>using subtitles</strong>. This may seem like a dumb or useless feature to use while mining, but for me it works like a cave finder. If you are mining around Y coordinate 10, which most players do, you will be able to track nearby caves very easily. Whenever you see the subtitle &quot;lava pops&quot;, you know you are near a cave. Look in the direction the subtitles tell the sound comes from, and start digging. The sounds that are coming from a distance and are detected by the subtitles are nearly undetectable by plain listening (at least for me).</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XMru.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XMru.png" alt="Subtitles." /></a></p>
<p>So, if you like exploring caves, this is the way to massively boost your chances of finding one.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 8 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>Here's a good method for getting up and down from your mine quickly without needing elaborate water elevators or expensive minecart tracks.  </p>

<p>First, get some sticks and build at least one full stack of ladders.</p>

<p>Then, dig a single-block column into a mountain two-high and three long.  Place a torch at the far end on top for lighting.  Then dig three down into your column, and place your ladders heading up to the face of the mountain where your column starts.</p>

<p>Dig away from the ladder into the column, two blocks high and three blocks out, and then down as you did with your initial colum, placing torches and ladders in likewise positions.  Continue to mine downward in this manner, and you should have a 'staircase' that looks like this: (X = Walls, O = Open Space)</p>

<pre><code>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
OOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XOOOOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XOOOOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXOOOOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXOOOOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXOOOOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXOOOOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXOOOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre>

<p>What this creates is a three-deep 'step' that you can walk down without having to worry about fall damage, and a ladder back to the surface going the opposite direction.  </p>

<p>It may take a bit of experimenting to get it just right, and you can't hesitate when walking into it or you'll accidentally climb the ladder a little and take some fall damage (very minor).  To reduce the chance of this, you can use a two-deep step instead, though it won't be as fast going down.  </p>

<p>The additional benefit of the three-long column is that the middle of each 'step' makes a perfect starting place for branch mining once you reach your desired depth.  </p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>i would like to add some (CREATIVITY) to the branch mining.</p>

<p>conventional branch mining is explained above. also in <em>seven sided die</em>'s answer there is mention that veins occur in <strong>2x2 blocks</strong>.</p>

<p>we generally think mining in term of 2d lets consider the third dimension.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BYtoX.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BYtoX.jpg" alt="made an illustration showing the method"></a></p>

<p>(this is just an illustration) so the wool is to show that 4 spaces are left between corridors.</p>

<p>reason for leaving 4 spaces :-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Assuming that veins occur in <strong>2x2 blocks</strong>) the vein has possibility of appearing in center 2 block (out of 4 wool block  i.e pink and blue wool in this figure) so it can be spotted while mining corridors on alternate floor (1st , 3rd , 5th, .....)</p></li>
<li><p>same rule of possibility of spotting veins apply to corridor on (2nd , 4th , 6th, .....)</p></li>
<li><p>the above shows the possible center block vein. block adjacent to cyan and maroon (in shown figure) can be easily seen so no doubt about that.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>so this method reduces number of blocks mined and increases efficiency with respect to time.</p>

<p><strong>Key assumptions : veins appear in 2x2xX</strong>(there is very very less probability of generating 1x1x1 vein ).</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I took this to the extreme and after of ~30 hours of minecraft with maxed out equipment I got this results:</p>
<p>Cave mining: ~80 diamonds, ~350 iron ore, ~90 gold, ~250 redstone blocks</p>
<p>Branch mining: ~140 dia, ~200 iron, ~60 gold, dunno how much RS</p>
<p>Mining out a space 100x100x10 blocks (exactly): ~15 dia, ~100 iron, ? gold, ~150 RS blocks.</p>
<p>X-Ray, 2 hours: ~280 dia ore, ~150 iron, ~110 gold, ~20 RS blocks, 25 emeralds.</p>
<p>Each method was good for somthing: The cave method for Iron &amp; RS, the Branch mine for diamonds and the last method for losing time, getting tons of stone and breaking every last one of your pickaxes. Then the x-ray method was super, max diamonds, no coal, no Redstone. That's it.<br />
Note that the branch mine has each branch, even the main ones are 350 blocks long.</p>
