So far I've just been digging around just above bedrock on a whim to look for these rare minerals but I've started thinking that I should be taking a more controlled, efficient approach to mining.</p>

<p><strong>What is the optimal mining strategy that yields the most rare minerals while minimizing blocks removed and time spent digging and traveling?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The existing answers are great for mining, but no one has addressed travel time to and from the mine which is usually ~60 blocks downward and incredibly tedious. Solutions?</p>
