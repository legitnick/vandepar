This thread began in Jun 1999, and <code>str.join</code> was included in Python 1.6 which was released in Sep 2000 (and supported Unicode). Python 2.0 (supported <code>str</code> methods including <code>join</code>) was released in Oct 2000.</p>
<ul>
<li>There were four options proposed in this thread:
<ul>
<li><code>str.join(seq)</code></li>
<li><code>seq.join(str)</code></li>
<li><code>seq.reduce(str)</code></li>
<li><code>join</code> as a built-in function</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guido wanted to support not only <code>list</code>s and <code>tuple</code>s, but all sequences/iterables.</li>
<li><code>seq.reduce(str)</code> is difficult for newcomers.</li>
<li><code>seq.join(str)</code> introduces unexpected dependency from sequences to str/unicode.</li>
<li><code>join()</code> as a free-standing built-in function would support only specific data types. So using a built-in namespace is not good. If <code>join()</code> were to support many data types, creating an optimized implementation would be difficult: if implemented using the <code>__add__</code> method then it would be O(n²).</li>
<li>The separator string (<code>sep</code>) should not be omitted. Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some additional thoughts (my own, and my friend's):</p>
<ul>
<li>Unicode support was coming, but it was not final. At that time UTF-8 was the most likely about to replace UCS-2/-4. To calculate total buffer length for UTF-8 strings, the method needs to know the character encoding.</li>
<li>At that time, Python had already decided on a common sequence interface rule where a user could create a sequence-like (iterable) class. But Python didn't support extending built-in types until 2.2. At that time it was difficult to provide basic <code>iterable</code> class (which is mentioned in another comment).</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Historical note.</strong> When I first learned
Python, I expected join to be a method
of a list, which would take the
delimiter as an argument. Lots of
people feel the same way, and there’s
a story behind the join method. Prior
to Python 1.6, strings didn’t have all
these useful methods. There was a
separate string module which contained
all the string functions; each
function took a string as its first
argument. The functions were deemed
important enough to put onto the
strings themselves, which made sense
for functions like lower, upper, and
split. But many hard-core Python
programmers objected to the new join
method, arguing that it should be a
method of the list instead, or that it
shouldn’t move at all but simply stay
a part of the old string module (which
still has lots of useful stuff in it).
I use the new join method exclusively,
but you will see code written either
way, and if it really bothers you, you
can use the old string.join function
instead.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 78 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>I agree that it's counterintuitive at first, but there's a good reason. Join can't be a method of a list because:</p>

<ul>
<li>it must work for different iterables too (tuples, generators, etc.) </li>
<li>it must have different behavior between different types of strings.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are actually two join methods (Python 3.0):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b"".join
&lt;built-in method join of bytes object at 0x00A46800&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; "".join
&lt;built-in method join of str object at 0x00A28D40&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If join was a method of a list, then it would have to inspect its arguments to decide which one of them to call. And you can't join byte and str together, so the way they have it now makes sense. </p>

<p>Why is it <code>string.join(list)</code> instead of <code>list.join(string)</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because <code>join</code> is a &quot;string&quot; method! It creates a string from any iterable. If we stuck the method on lists, what about when we have iterables that aren't lists?</p>
<p>What if you have a tuple of strings? If this were a <code>list</code> method, you would have to cast every such iterator of strings as a <code>list</code> before you could join the elements into a single string! For example:</p>
<pre><code>some_strings = ('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
</code></pre>
<p>Let's roll our own list join method:</p>
<pre><code>class OurList(list): 
    def join(self, s):
        return s.join(self)
</code></pre>
<p>And to use it, note that we have to first create a list from each iterable to join the strings in that iterable, wasting both memory and processing power:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = OurList(some_strings) # step 1, create our list
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.join(', ') # step 2, use our list join method!
'foo, bar, baz'
</code></pre>
<p>So we see we have to add an extra step to use our list method, instead of just using the builtin string method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ' | '.join(some_strings) # a single step!
'foo | bar | baz'
</code></pre>
<h2>Performance Caveat for Generators</h2>
<p>The algorithm Python uses to create the final string with <code>str.join</code> actually has to pass over the iterable twice, so if you provide it a generator expression, it has to materialize it into a list first before it can create the final string.</p>
<p>Thus, while passing around generators is usually better than list comprehensions, <code>str.join</code> is an exception:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: ''.join(str(i) for i in range(10) if i)))
3.839168446022086
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: ''.join([str(i) for i in range(10) if i])))
3.339879313018173
</code></pre>
<p>Nevertheless, the <code>str.join</code> operation is still semantically a &quot;string&quot; operation, so it still makes sense to have it on the <code>str</code> object than on miscellaneous iterables.</p>
