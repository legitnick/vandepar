<p>Every time I jump for the flagpole and my 5000 points, I still remember this and wonder about it. On a few occasions, it seems as though I'm about to make it! Mario is on course to leap to freedom! However I always find myself "pulled" back to the top of the flagpole.</p>

<p>Is there any way to completely clear the flagpole at the end of a level?</p>

<h2>But wait... there's more!</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, it can also be done on <strong>level 1-1</strong> as <a href="http://www.cinemassacre.com/2011/01/12/how-to-jump-the-flagpole-on-stage-1-in-super-mario-bros/" rel="noreferrer">Mike</a> describes in this video:</p>

<p>Game Trailers provides a great video about the Mario Flag Pole jumping myth in an <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/video/episode-2-pop-fiction/100619" rel="noreferrer">episode of Pop-Fiction</a>.</p>

<p>But it can also be done with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Genie" rel="noreferrer">Game Genie</a> or other "hacks".</p>

But then it triggers a bug and Mario dies :(</p>
