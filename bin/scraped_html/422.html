<p>Every time I jump for the flagpole and my 5000 points, I still remember this and wonder about it. On a few occasions, it seems as though I'm about to make it! Mario is on course to leap to freedom! However I always find myself "pulled" back to the top of the flagpole.</p>

<p>Is there any way to completely clear the flagpole at the end of a level?</p>
