<p>It seems someone playing on my friend's SMP server decided that it would be a good idea for him to do some <em>testing</em> with TNT.</p>

<p>Now, he's conscientiously set this atrocity up a reasonable distance from the rest of the construction on the server, so I don't think that it will effect any damage in the other projects, but someone still has to get rid of it.  <strong>Guess Who</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<p>This is what I've come up with, as a means of surviving the cataclysm:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bt3pP.png" alt="Obsidian Shelter"></p>

<p>However, this shelter is of course, based on the assumption that since Obsidian cannot be destroyed by explosions, it will act as a barrier to their consequences.  If I were to hide inside this shelter, would I emerge unscathed after detonating the TNT?</p>
