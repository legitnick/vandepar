<p>I have a nice little stone house, but as Ghasts and zombie pigmen can spawn at "any light level" in the Nether, how do I keep them from popping up in my Nether regions where I don't want them?  Will they even spawn on "foreign" blocks (e.g. those that aren't Netherrack, slow sand, etc.)</p>

<p>You don't have to worry about Zombie Pigmen (they are, after all, neutral mobs until provoked).</p>

<p>Ghasts can safely be kept out by restricting yourself to not using any of the 4x4x4 (or larger!) areas that they need to spawn. <strong>Keep a tight ceiling</strong>, and you'll be fine.</p>

The easiest way to get them to not spawn is to simply move out of the nether fort that you have set up shop in. The pigmen will be and always are a problem but if left alone they are just annoying.</p>

<p>If you are set on being in a nether fort though, then I suggest half slabs. Nothing likes spawning on top of half slabs regardless of how much space overhead you need.. Also keep in mind a Ghast loves to spawn in a 5x5x5 area. Having one of them appear in your house really really sucks.</p>

You can also make a trap with some dispensers to get some pork and gunpowder.</p>

<p>You can use carpet as flooring in the nether house.</p>

<p>The cherry on the cake of decorating the house is complete elimination of mob spawning within the house.</p>
