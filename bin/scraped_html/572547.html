<li>A static variable inside a function keeps its value between invocations.</li>
<li>A static global variable or a function is "seen" only in the file it's declared in</li>
</ol>

<p>(1) is the more foreign topic if you're a newbie, so here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void foo()
{
    int a = 10;
    static int sa = 10;

    a += 5;
    sa += 5;

    printf("a = %d, sa = %d\n", a, sa);
}


int main()
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
        foo();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This prints:</p>

<pre><code>a = 15, sa = 15
a = 15, sa = 20
a = 15, sa = 25
a = 15, sa = 30
a = 15, sa = 35
a = 15, sa = 40
a = 15, sa = 45
a = 15, sa = 50
a = 15, sa = 55
a = 15, sa = 60
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful for cases where a function needs to keep some state between invocations, and you don't want to use global variables. Beware, however, this feature should be used very sparingly - it makes your code not thread-safe and harder to understand.</p>

<p>(2) Is used widely as an "access control" feature. If you have a .c file implementing some functionality, it usually exposes only a few "public" functions to users. The rest of its functions should be made <code>static</code>, so that the user won't be able to access them. This is encapsulation, a good practice.</p>

<p>Quoting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the C programming language, static
  is used with global variables and
  functions to set their scope to the
  containing file. In local variables,
  static is used to store the variable
  in the statically allocated memory
  instead of the automatically allocated
  memory. While the language does not
  dictate the implementation of either
  type of memory, statically allocated
  memory is typically reserved in data
  segment of the program at compile
  time, while the automatically
  allocated memory is normally
  implemented as a transient call stack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to answer your second question, it's not like in C#.</p>

<p>In C++, however, <code>static</code> is also used to define class attributes (shared between all objects of the same class) and methods. In C there are no classes, so this feature is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Here I illustrate how static affects the scope of function definitions across multiple files.</p>

<p>a.c</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/*
Undefined behavior: already defined in main.
Binutils 2.24 gives an error and refuses to link.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27667277/why-does-borland-compile-with-multiple-definitions-of-same-object-in-different-c
*/
/*int i = 0;*/

/* Works in GCC as an extension: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3692486/895245 */
/*int i;*/

/* OK: extern. Will use the one in main. */
extern int i;

/* OK: only visible to this file. */
static int si = 0;

void a() {
    i++;
    si++;
    puts("a()");
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    printf("si = %d\n", si);
    puts("");
}
</code></pre>

<p>main.c</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int i = 0;
static int si = 0;

void a();    

void m() {
    i++;
    si++;
    puts("m()");
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
    printf("si = %d\n", si);
    puts("");
}

int main() {
    m();
    m();
    a();
    a();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cirosantilli/cpp-cheat/tree/b075d2d54c62c684cd03c17bb39fa1d6a8fd9bd6/static" rel="noreferrer">GitHub upstream</a>.</p>

<p>Compile and run:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -c a.c -o a.o
gcc -c main.c -o main.o
gcc -o main main.o a.o
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>m()
i = 1
si = 1

m()
i = 2
si = 2

a()
i = 3
si = 1

a()
i = 4
si = 2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>there are two separate variables for <code>si</code>, one for each file</li>
<li>there is a single shared variable for <code>i</code></li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, the smaller the scope, the better, so always declare variables <code>static</code> if you can.</p>

<p>In C programming, files are often used to represent "classes", and <code>static</code> variables represent private static members of the class.</p>

<p><strong>What standards say about it</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf" rel="noreferrer">C99 N1256 draft</a> 6.7.1 "Storage-class specifiers" says that <code>static</code> is a "storage-class specifier".</p>

<p>6.2.2/3 "Linkages of identifiers" says <code>static</code> implies <code>internal linkage</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the declaration of a file scope identifier for an object or a function contains the storage-class specifier static, the identifier has internal linkage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and 6.2.2/2 says that <code>internal linkage</code> behaves like in our example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the set of translation units and libraries that constitutes an entire program, each declaration of a particular identifier with external linkage denotes the same object or function. Within one translation unit, each declaration of an identifier with internal linkage denotes the same object or function. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>where "translation unit is a source file after preprocessing.</p>

<p><strong>How GCC implements it for ELF (Linux)?</strong></p>

<p>With the <code>STB_LOCAL</code> binding.</p>

<p>If we compile:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 0;
static int si = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>and disassemble the symbol table with:</p>

<pre><code>readelf -s main.o
</code></pre>

<p>the output contains:</p>

<pre><code>Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
  5: 0000000000000004     4 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT    4 si
 10: 0000000000000000     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT    4 i
</code></pre>

<p>so the binding is the only significant difference between them. <code>Value</code> is just their offset into the <code>.bss</code> section, so we expect it to differ.</p>

<p><code>STB_LOCAL</code> is documented on the ELF spec at <a href="http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/2003-12-17/ch4.symtab.html" rel="noreferrer">http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/2003-12-17/ch4.symtab.html</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>STB_LOCAL Local symbols are not visible outside the object file containing their definition. Local symbols of the same name may exist in multiple files without interfering with each other</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which makes it a perfect choice to represent <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>Variables without static are <code>STB_GLOBAL</code>, and the spec says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the link editor combines several relocatable object files, it does not allow multiple definitions of STB_GLOBAL symbols with the same name. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is coherent with the link errors on multiple non static definitions.</p>

<p>If we crank up the optimization with <code>-O3</code>, the <code>si</code> symbol is removed entirely from the symbol table: it cannot be used from outside anyways. TODO why keep static variables on the symbol table at all when there is no optimization? Can they be used for anything? Maybe for debugging.</p>

<p><strong>C++ anonymous namespaces</strong></p>

<p>In C++, you might want to use anonymous namespaces instead of static, which achieves a similar effect, but further hides type definitions: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/154469/unnamed-anonymous-namespaces-vs-static-functions">Unnamed/anonymous namespaces vs. static functions</a></p>

<pre><code>int foo()

<h3>a.c:</h3>
<pre><code>static int foo()

<p>It means that this function has scope only in this file. So a.c and b.c can have different <code>foo()</code>s, and foo is not exposed to shared objects. So if you defined foo in a.c you couldn't access it from <code>b.c</code> or from any other places.</p>
