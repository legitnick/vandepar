Respect for MIME types is of course client driven, so <code>text/plain</code> may do for transfer of bytes, but then you would be pushing up interpretation to the vendor application domain unnecessarily - <code>application/json</code>. Would you transfer XML via <code>text/plain</code>?</p>

<p>But honestly, your choice of MIME type is advice to the client as to how to interpret the data- <code>text/plain</code> or <code>text/HTML</code> (when it's not HTML) is like type erasure- it's as uninformative as making all your objects of type Object in a typed language.</p>

<p>No browser runtime I know of will take a JSON document and automatically make it available to the runtime as a JavaScript accessible object without intervention, but if you are working with a crippled client, that's an entirely different matter. But that's not the whole story- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services">RESTful</a> JSON services often don't have JavaScript runtimes, but it doesn't stop them using JSON as a viable data interchange format.

<p><strong>JSONP</strong>
JSONP ("JSON with padding") is handled different way than JSON, in a browser. JSONP is treated as a regular JavaScript script and therefore it should use <code>application/javascript,</code> the current official MIME type for JavaScript. In many cases, however, <code>text/javascript</code> MIME type will work fine too.</p>

<p>Note that <code>text/javascript</code> has been marked as obsolete by <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt" rel="noreferrer">RFC 4329</a> (Scripting Media Types) document and it is recommended to use <code>application/javascript</code> type instead.

While the default encoding is UTF-8, it is worth mentioning that it could also be UTF-16 or UTF-32. When JSON is written in UTF-16 or UTF-32, binary content-transfer-encoding must be used.</p>
<p>There is more information about JSON in <em><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4627" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 4627: The application/json Media Type for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a></em></p>

<p>"Accept:application/json" is a desired response format.</p>

<p>"Content-Type:application/json" specifies the content format of your request, but sometimes you specify both <code>application/json</code> and <code>application/xml</code>, but the quality of these might be different. Which server will send back the different response formats, look at the example:</p>

<pre><code>Accept:application/json;q=0.4,application/xml;q=8
</code></pre>

<p>This will return XML, because XML has higher quality.</p>

</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 10 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>As some research,</p>
<p>The most common MIME type is</p>
<p><strong>application/json</strong></p>
<p>Let's see a example to differentiate with JSON and JavaScript.</p>
<ul>
<li>application/json</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used when it is not known how this data will be used. When the information is to be just extracted from the server in JSON format, it may be through a link or from any file, in that case, it is used.</p>
<p>For example-</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

    header('Content-type:application/json');

    $directory = [
            ['Id' =&gt; 1, 'Name' =&gt; 'this'],
            ['Id' =&gt; 2, 'Name' =&gt; 'is'],
            ['Id' =&gt; 3, 'Name' =&gt; 'Stack Overflow'],
        ];

    // Showing the JSON data

    echo json_encode($directory);
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The output is,</p>
<pre><code>[{&quot;Id&quot;:1, &quot;Name&quot;:&quot;this&quot;}, {&quot;Id&quot;:2, &quot;Name&quot;:&quot;is&quot;}, {&quot;Id&quot;:3, &quot;Name&quot;:&quot;Stack Overflow&quot;}]
</code></pre>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>application/javascript</li>
</ul>
<p>It is used when the use of the data is predefined. It is used by applications in which there are calls by the client-side Ajax applications. It is used when the data is of type JSON-P or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP" rel="noreferrer">JSONP</a>.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

    header('Content-type:application/javascript');

    $dir = [
            ['Id' =&gt; 1, 'Name' =&gt; 'this' ],
            ['Id' =&gt; 2, 'Name' =&gt; 'is'],
            ['Id' =&gt; 3, 'Name' =&gt; 'Stack Overflow'],
    ];

    echo &quot;Function_call(&quot; . json_encode($dir) . &quot;);&quot;;
?&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The output is,</p>
<pre><code>Function_call([{&quot;Id&quot;:1, &quot;Name&quot;:&quot;this&quot;}, {&quot;Id&quot;:2, &quot;Name&quot;:&quot;is&quot;}, {&quot;Id&quot;:3, &quot;Name&quot;:&quot;Stack Overflow&quot;}])
</code></pre>
<p>And for other MIME types, see the full detail in <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types" rel="noreferrer">MIME types (IANA media types)</a></em>.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 7 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>A part of your question is relevant to me as I just came across it.</p>
<p>A third-party provider is providing a REST service that is used by multiple clients. It's a straight-forward REST called with query parameters that returns a well-formed JSON. I have tested it with PHP and Java where it worked as expected.</p>
<p>My client uses Oracle Service Bus as a gateway between his application server and the Internet. When I made the OSB service, it crashed with an <code>Invalid message format</code> error. Turned out that the <code>content-type</code> being returned was <code>text/html</code>. OSB treats responses as per this header; converting between text, XML and JSON. In this case, the response was JSON but the header didn't say so. Contacting the provider, I got the reply: &quot;We're not going to change it as it doesn't effect anyone else&quot;.</p>
<p>The <code>Content-Type</code> header specifies what the content <strong>should</strong> be, not what it <strong>actually</strong> is. That is to say, in your consuming program, it's up to you to check or ignore it and process the content in any manner. Another example, you can return GIF data but specify the content type as JSON, then go ahead and ignore the header and read the image data. This won't hurt your program, but may hurt others.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Play nice.</p>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 6 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>It depends on the point of view.</p>
<p>If you are the client sending a request, then <code>application/json</code> is the right choice.</p>
<p>But if you are the server receiving a request, you have to be prepared, that the client may also send the encoding. So <code>application/json</code> and <code>application/json; charset=utf-8</code> are valid.</p>
<p>The media type is the same in both cases. But the content type differs.</p>
