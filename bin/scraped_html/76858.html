Obviously GameShark and Game Genie never got inside access to place their own cheats into <em>every game</em>. I don't think any developers gave them the source code to pour over for codes. And I don't think the original development process for these games included placing any of these codes themselves. So, what is a GameShark or Game Genie code, really?</p>

<p>Both of them usually take the form of a relatively short hexadecimal string (or multiple if that is the case) so my intuition tells me they use the same principle. But are they just memory addresses to flip a bit? Or lock it? Or XOR a series of bits with something? What is the code, and what does it do?</p>
