Is Minecraft Turing-Complete, i.e. can it be used to simulate a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing Machine</a> (if we ignore the problem of infinite memory)?</p>

<p>A couple people have even constructed ALUs and CPUs, for instance the following one.  The creator was planning on adding a memory array to allow programming it.</p>

<p>If you're talking about infinite-sized redstone buildings, well, you can quite easily build conway's game of life in minecraft, which is turing complete.
The "quite easily" won't work if we were in a 2D Minecraft space, and there, well, that's an interesting question :)</p>

<p>Here's a neat example of an implementation:</p>
