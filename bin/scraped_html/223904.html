<p>Do we know if Endurance increases HP in the Dwellers, or that strength helps in melee damage / survivability in the wastelands? And Perception?</p>

<h2>Tip:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I set my shelter that way, to have the medbay spread in the vault to handle fire faster.</li>
<li>the difference in having 1 or 2 intelligence is that a dweller with 2 intelligence levels up in half the time</li>
<li>queuing my new matured dwellers to go to school so they get intelligence 2 or 3 then endurance for max HP and after that their main stat - super efficient</li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE:
If you want to nerd out on more specifics, I recommend <strong>Section 7</strong> of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nai09D_aM2syl3iPP5hkveDcOUwhsoUDR6s1lwC0e8c/edit?pli=1#gid=0" rel="noreferrer">Fallout Shelter Efficiency Data</a>. </p>

<p>Also, here someone suggests that <strong>skills above 10</strong> continue to benefit the dweller/explorer: </p>
