<p>The above command will change your branch name, but you have to be very careful using the renamed branch, because it will still refer to the old upstream branch associated with it, if any.</p>

<p>If you want to push some changes into master after your local branch is renamed into new_branch_name (example name):</p>

<p><code>git push origin new_branch_name:master</code> (now changes will go to master branch but your local branch name is new_branch_name)</p>

<h3>1. Rename your local branch</h3>

<p>If you are on the branch you want to rename:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m new-name
</code></pre>

<p>If you are on a different branch:</p>

<pre><code>git branch -m old-name new-name
</code></pre>

<h3>2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch</h3>

<pre><code>git push origin :old-name new-name

<h3>3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch</h3>

<pre><code>git push origin -u new-name
</code></pre>
</div><p class="this-has-helped">This answer has helped 137 people.</p><div class="s-prose js-post-body"><p>The answers so far have been correct, but here is some additional information:</p>

<p>One can safely rename a branch with '-m' (move), but one has to be careful with '-M', because it forces the rename, even if there is an existing branch with the same name already. Here is the excerpt from the 'git-branch' man page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a -m or -M option, <code>&lt;oldbranch&gt;</code> will be renamed to <code>&lt;newbranch&gt;</code>. If <code>&lt;oldbranch&gt;</code> had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match <code>&lt;newbranch&gt;</code>, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch renaming. If <code>&lt;newbranch&gt;</code> exists, -M must be used to force the rename to happen.</p>

<p>You can also rename the <em>local</em> branch, but keep tracking the old name on the remote.</p>
<pre><code>git branch -m old_branch new_branch
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch:old_branch
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when you run <code>git push</code>, the remote <code>old_branch</code> ref is updated with your local <code>new_branch</code>.</p>
<p><strong>You have to know and remember</strong> this configuration. But it can be useful if you don't have the choice for the remote branch name, but you don't like it (oh, I mean, you've got a <em>very good</em> reason not to like it !) and prefer a clearer name for your local branch.</p>
<p>Playing with the fetch configuration, you can even rename the local remote-reference. i.e, having a <code>refs/remote/origin/new_branch</code> ref pointer to the branch, that is in fact the <code>old_branch</code> on <code>origin</code>. However, I highly discourage this, for the safety of your mind.</p>

<p>Before we begin, make sure you’ve selected the branch you want to rename:</p>

<p>If you want to see all of your local branches, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>git branch --list

<p>When you’re all clear, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using the Git rename branch command will require you to add an <strong>-m</strong> option to your command:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -m new-name
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>You can also rename a local branch from another branch by using the following two commands:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master

git branch -m old-name new-name

</li>
<li><p>Lastly, this command will list all — both local and remote — branches to verify that it has been renamed:</p>

<p>Although it isn’t possible to rename a remote branch directly, the process of renaming one involves these two easy steps:</p>
