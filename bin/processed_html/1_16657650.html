    <p>I want to mark up a phone number as callable link in an HTML document. I have read <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-faq#How_do_you_mark_up_a_phone_extension" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the microformats approach</a>, and I know, that the <code>tel:</code> scheme would be standard, but is quite literally nowhere implemented.</p>
    <p>Skype defines, as far as I know, <code>skype:</code> and <code>callto:</code>, the latter having gained some popularity. I assume, that other companies have either other schemes or jump on the <code>callto:</code> train.</p>
    <p>What would be a best practice to mark-up a phone number, so that as many people as possible with VoIP software can just click on a link to get a call?</p>
    <p>Bonus question: Does anyone know about complications with emergency numbers such as 911 in US or 110 in Germany?</p>
    <p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft NetMeeting takes <code>callto:</code> schemes under WinXP. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1009181/url-scheme-for-phone-call">This question</a> suggests, that Microsoft Office Communicator will handle <code>tel:</code> schemes but not <code>callto:</code> ones. Great, Redmond!</p>
    <p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Two and a half years later now. It seems to boil down to what you want to do with the number. In mobile context, <code>tel:</code> is the way to go. Targeting desktops it's up to you, if you think your users are more Skype people (<code>callto:</code>) or will more likely have something like Google Voice (<code>tel:</code>) installed. My personal opinion is, when in doubt use <code>tel:</code> (in line with @Sidnicious' answer).</p>
    <p><strong>Update 3:</strong> User @rybo111 noted, that Skype in Chrome has meanwhile jumped on the <code>tel:</code> bandwagon. I cannot verify this, because no machine with both at hand, but if it's true, it means we have finally a winner here: <code>tel:</code></p>
