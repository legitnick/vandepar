<p>I'm trying to use Excel VBA to write to a text file.  I'm doing a few of these:</p>

<pre><code>MyFile1 = "C:\outputFromExcel1.txt"
fnum1 = FreeFile()
Open MyFile1 For Output As fnum1
</code></pre>

<p>and then writing to them like this:</p>

<pre><code>Print #fnum1, text
</code></pre>

<p>All variables in the above are declared just with <code>Dim</code>.  I'm writing hundreds of lines to the files and, very rarely, lines are being truncated -- i.e. the ends are being chopped off.  Is there a better way to write to a file in Excel VBA?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've just realized that it's always the last lines to be written that are truncated.  So I guess I need to close or flush the files somehow?</p>
