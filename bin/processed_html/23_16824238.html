<p>Why all the complication?</p>
<p>The simple answer to the original question is just:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    while (x &gt; 0)
    {
        printf("%d ", x);
        x = x-1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It does the same thing. I am not saying you should do it like this, but it does the same thing and would have answered the question in one post.</p>
<p>The <code>x--</code> is just shorthand for the above, and <code>&gt;</code> is just a normal greater-than <code>operator</code>. No big mystery!</p>
<p>There are too many people making simple things complicated nowadays  ;)</p>
