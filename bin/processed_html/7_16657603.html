        <p>Here is the correct solution to solving this problem:</p>

        <pre><code>public void hideProgress() {
    if(mProgressDialog != null) {
        if(mProgressDialog.isShowing()) { //check if dialog is showing.

            //get the Context object that was used to great the dialog
            Context context = ((ContextWrapper)mProgressDialog.getContext()).getBaseContext();

            //if the Context used here was an activity AND it hasn't been finished or destroyed
            //then dismiss it
            if(context instanceof Activity) { 
                if(!((Activity)context).isFinishing() &amp;&amp; !((Activity)context).isDestroyed()) 
                    mProgressDialog.dismiss();
            } else //if the Context used wasnt an Activity, then dismiss it too
                mProgressDialog.dismiss();
        }
        mProgressDialog = null;
    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <p>Instead of blindly catching all exceptions, this solution addresses the root of the problem: trying to dimiss a dialog when the activity used to initialize the dialog has already been finished. Working on my Nexus 4 running KitKat, but should work for all versions of Android.</p>
