<p>Apart from the alternative solutions that were posted here (which are correct), no one has actually answered your question by addressing what was wrong with your code.</p>

<p>It seems as though you were trying to implement a <a href="http://www.algolist.net/Algorithms/Sorting/Selection_sort">selection sort</a> algorithm. I will not go into the details of how sorting works here, but I have included a few links for your reference =) </p>

<p>Your code was syntactically correct, but logically wrong. You were partially sorting your strings <em>by only comparing each string with the strings that came after it</em>. Here is a corrected version (I retained as much of your original code to illustrate what was "wrong" with it):</p>

<pre><code>static  String Array[]={" Hello " , " This " , "is ", "Sorting ", "Example"};
String  temp;

//Keeps track of the smallest string's index
int  shortestStringIndex; 

public static void main(String[] args)  
{              

 //I reduced the upper bound from Array.length to (Array.length - 1)
 for(int j=0; j &lt; Array.length - 1;j++)
 {
     shortestStringIndex = j;

     for (int i=j+1 ; i&lt;Array.length; i++)
     {
         //We keep track of the index to the smallest string
         if(Array[i].trim().compareTo(Array[shortestStringIndex].trim())&lt;0)
         {
             shortestStringIndex = i;  
         }
     }
     //We only swap with the smallest string
     if(shortestStringIndex != j)
     {
         String temp = Array[j];
         Array[j] = Array[shortestStringIndex]; 
         Array[shortestStringIndex] = temp;
     }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this approach is that its <a href="http://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/">asymptotic complexity is <strong>O(n^2)</strong></a>. In simplified words, it gets very slow as the size of the array grows (approaches infinity). You may want to read about <a href="http://www.algolist.net/Algorithms/">better ways to sort data</a>, such as <a href="http://www.algolist.net/Algorithms/Sorting/Quicksort">quicksort</a>.</p>
